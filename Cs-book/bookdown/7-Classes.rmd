# Classes {#Classes1}
In Chapter \@ref(CSharpBasics) you have learned basic
programming with classes using C\#. This chapter builds upon this
background and explains: various members (or constituents) of a
class; their programming aspects; and related topics. Therefore,
objectives for this chapter are to:

    - Introduce various components of a class --- fields,
      properties, methods, indexers, events, delegates, and attributes.
    - Illustrate the process of declaring classes, and
      instantiating class instances.
    - Explain various field types and field modifiers, and
      illustrate programming with fields.
    - Illustrate the distinction between value and reference
      types.
    - Discuss method types, declaring and implementing methods,
      constructors, destructors, and properties.
    - Illustrate techniques for exchanging data between the
      methods --- *parameter passing*
    - Explain the concept of *method overloading* and
      demonstrate its use.
    - Illustrate implementing aggregation and composition
      relationships between the classes.
    - Introduce *structures* as light-weight classes.
    - Explain *boxing* and *unboxing* --- mechanisms
      to convert a value type into a reference type (boxing), and a
      reference type into a value type (unboxing).

## Class Components 
Recall that an object is an *abstraction* of a real-world
entity, or a concept. A set of objects with identical
*structural* and *functional* characteristics are
grouped under a class. In other words, a class prescribes a
template, and instances of it represent instantiations of the
template by assigning values to the attributes that comprise the
class structure. A typical software application will have several
classes. A *class diagram* depicts classes and static
relationships between them. A class may fulfill its
responsibilities by invoking its own methods, invoking the methods
of other classes, or a combination of both. The act of a
class/object invoking the method of another class is referred to
as *sending a message*. In other words, messages are the
communication mechanism for objects to invoke each other's methods
in cooperatively solving a problem. Organizing a solution to a
problem around classes contributes to containing the complexity of
the problem through suitable *domain abstractions*. Now let
us delve into specifics of classes in the context of C\#
programming language.


As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ClassAnatomy), a C\# class, in
general, is comprised of fields, methods, properties, indexers,
events, delegates, and attributes. We refer to these components as
*class constituents* or *class members*.
*Fields* provide a mechanism for representing the state of
an object. *Methods* are the actual code that help realize class
behavior. Method execution may result in changing the state of an
object.*Method Properties* are special methods which provide controlled
access *controlled access* to the fields using a simple and
natural syntax.Indexers, events, delegates, and attributes are discussed in
Chapter \@ref(AdvCSharpConstructs).

## Class Declaration and Instantiation
The primary purpose of EmployeeApp.cs program shown in
Listing \@ref(EmplCls) is to illustrate the process of
declaring and creating classes, and the use of *this*
keyword. To quickly understand a program at a high level, a class
diagram like the one shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:EmployeeAppClsDiagram) is more helpful than going
through the corresponding code (EmployeeApp.cs). Class diagrams
(rather than code listings) are used in communicating with other
developers especially when the system is large and several
developers are involved. Other developers are not so much
interested in looking at your code, rather they are interested
only in how to communicate with your classes. Class diagrams show
such information at the right abstraction level. As you progress
through this course, you should become familiar with developing
class diagrams. Tools for developing class diagrams include
Rational Rose, TogetherSoft Suite, and Microsoft Visio. Visual
Studio.NET also features plug-in capability so that third party
object modeling and design tools can work within the Studio
environment.

```{r EmployeeAppClsDiagram, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="EmployeeApp.cs class diagram"}

```

In UML notation, a class is represented by a rectangle, which is
divided horizontally into three compartments. The top compartment
lists class name, the middle one shows fields, and the bottom one
lists all methods including constructors, and properties. The tag
$\ll$*implementation class*$\gg$ placed above the class name
is an UML *stereotype*. It simply says that the class is an
implementation class --- has enough detail for direct
implementation and is often tied to a programming language (in our
case, it is C\#). Notice the access modifier (e.g., +, -, \#)
prefixes of fields, properties, and methods. A plus (+) indicates
*public* access, minus (-) denotes *private* access,
and the pound symbol (\#) represents *protected* access.
Class members with *public* access modifier are visible to
all classes, and can be directly accessed by them; with
*private* access modifier, the members are visible only
within the class and only members of the class can directly access
them; and *protected* modifier enables direct access to the
class members, members of its derived classes, and members of
derived classes of derived classes, and so on.


There are two classes in this program: Employee (lines 4 -- 35),
and EmployeeTest (lines 36 -- 47). As the class diagram shows,
there is a dependency relationship from EmployeeTest to Employee.
EmployeeTest exists essentially to test the functionality of
Employee class. Employee class declares two fields of type
*string*: *name* and *dept* (line 6). Note
the *private* access modifier on this line. It says that
both the fields are private to the class --- not visible outside
the class. Therefore, there is no (direct) access to these fields
from outside the class. The class also declares another private
field, *salary*, which is of type *float* (line 7).
If you don't specify an access modifier for a field,
*private* is implicitly assigned.

The class has six methods. The Employee() method shown in lines 9
-- 14 is called a *constructor*.Thisis a special method 
used to create instances of the class. Its
access qualifier is typically *public* so that other
classes can create instances of this class. The method implicitly
returns a value which is of the class type itself. Therefore,
there is no need to specify a return value type in the method
header. Also, its name is same as that of the class. Creating an
instance is a two-step process. First, the *new* operator
is called which allocates storage on the heap. Second, the
constructor is called for initializing the state of the instance.
Since a class can have multiple constructors, which version is
called depends on the number, type, and order of arguments in the
constructor invocation.

The constructor has three parameters: *aName*,
*aDept*, and *salary*. The first two are of type
*string* and the last one is of *float* type. The
constructor assigns the values of these parameters to the fields
of an instance of the class. Note the use of the keyword
*this* on line 13. It refers to the object instance on
which this method (i.e., the constructor) is invoked. Assume that
we have named the first two method parameters as *name* and
*dept* (instead of *aName* and *aDept*). Then
the assignment statements on lines 11 and 12 should be written as:
name = name; dept = dept, which would have been very confusing.
The use of *this* keyword is very useful in removing this
ambiguity. In line 13, *this*.salary refers to the salary
field of the class instance which is being created, and the term
*salary* to the right of the assignment operator (i.e., =)
refers to the constructor parameter.


If the fields with *private* access qualifier need to be
made available (i.e., exposed) to other classes, there are two
choices: properties and accessor methods. Properties are discussed
in Section \@ref(Classes1Properties). Accessor methods are of
two types: *get* and *set*. A get method retrieves
the value of a field, whereas a set method modifies the value of a
field. Usually get and set method names are prefixed with "Get"
and "Set," respectively as in lines 15 and 23. Set methods don't
return values and this is indicated by the keyword *void*
in their method header (line 23). The return value of a get method
is same as that of the type of the field whose value it returns.

The get accessor method for the field *name*, GetName(), is
shown in lines 15 -- 18. It simply returns the value of
*name* field of the instance on which it is invoked. No set
accessor method is provided as the value of *name* field is
never intended to be changed after creating an instance. The get
and set accessor methods of the *dept* field are shown in
lines 19 -- 22 and 23 -- 26. The SetDept() method has one
parameter and the invoker of this method should provide a value
for it. The assignment statement of line 25 simply assigns the
parameter value to the instance's *dept* field. Notice the
use of *this* keyword to refer to the class instance on
which SetDept() method is invoked. Also, observe the return value
types of these methods as specified in their method headers. Lines
27 -- 30 and 31 -- 34 show get and set methods for the
*salary* field. Like constructor methods, get and set
methods typically have *public* access modifier.



The EmployeeTest class has only one method: Main(). When you run a
C\# program, execution begins at the first executable statement of
Main(). In every C\# program, at least one class should have the
Main() method. If multiple classes have Main() methods, one of
them should be explicitly designated so that the run time system
knows where to begin the execution. The access modifier of Main()
is *public*, returns nothing, and has another modifier
*static*. Therefore, Main() is a static method meaning that
you don't need to create instances of EmployeeTest class to invoke
the Main(). In other words, static methods are at the class level
and are invoked on the class itself rather than on the instances
of the class. Line 40 creates an instance of Employee class,
$emp$. Notice the use of the *new* keyword on this line as
well as invocation of the constructor with three values: "John M
Kerry," "Personnel," and 50000.00F. These three values, often
referred to as *method invocation arguments*, correspond to
the parameters of the constructor method. That is, the constructor
is invoked with "John M Kerry" as the value for *aName*
parameter; "Personnel" as the value for *aDept* parameter;
and the value 50000.00F for the *salary* parameter. There
is a one-to-one correspondence between the method invocation
argument values and the parameter names. The suffix F in 50000.00F
denotes that 50000.00 is a literal of *float* (F) type.


```{r EmployeeAppOut, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="EmployeeApp.cs program run results"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/Classes1/Illus/EmployeeAppOut.png")
```

The results from running EmployeeApp.cs are shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:EmployeeAppOut). Lines 41 -- 43 invoke the get
accessor methods --- GetName(), GetDept(), and GetSalary() --- on
the $emp$ instance. Line 44 invokes the set accessor method,
SetSalary(), to change $emp$ instance salary to 55000.00. This
change is confirmed by the output of line 45. Notice the syntax
\{1:C\} on this line to print the return value of emp.GetSalary()
in currency format. In passing, note that the .NET types ---
class, struct, enum, interface, and delegate --- can be assigned
one of the two access modifiers: *public*, or
*internal*. The default modifier for classes is
*internal*, which insures that the class's visibility is
restricted to types in its assembly. On the other hand, the
*public* modifier makes the class visible in other
assemblies as well.

## Fields Declaration and Field Modifiers

As indicated earlier, *fields* are a mechanism for
representing the state of an object. There are two general
categories of fields: static and instance. Each instance of a
class (i.e., an object) will have its own values for
*instance fields*. In other words, the scope of the instance
fields is limited to the object. *Static fields*, on the
other hand, are at the class level. Static fields are indicated by
using the modifier *static*. There is only one copy of the
*static field*, which is shared among all the class
instances.In fact, a static field is created when the class is first loaded. You can
access static fields without instantiating the class. For example,
the expression Math.PI, accesses the PI static field of the Math
class. The lifetime of a static field begins when the class is
loaded and ends when the class is destroyed. One common use of a
static field is to keep track of the number of instances of a
class. Another use is to store statistics about class instances.
For example, in a banking application, average monthly account
balance for customer account objects can be represented by a
static field. Such fields are typically computed.

options(knitr.table.format = "html") 

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# create column 1 vector
Column1 <- c("field :=", "fldModifiers :=", "fldModifier :=","varDcls :=","varDcl :=","varInitializer :=")

# create column 2 vector
Column2 <- c("{fldAttributes} {fldModifiers} fldType varDcls","fldModifier | fldModifiers fldModifier","internal | new | private | protected | public | readonly | static | volatile","varDcl | varDcls, varDcl","identifier | identifier = varInitializer","expression | arrayInitializer")

# create data frame

library(knitr)

kable(FieldEBNF, caption = "Partial EBNF for declaring fields") %>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

### Declaring a Field 
A field declaration consists of specifying its name, type,
modifiers, and optionally an initial value.
Partial EBNF for field declaration is
shown in Table \@ref(tab:FieldEBNF). As indicated in the first row
of the table, a field declaration consists of zero or more
attributes, followed by zero or more field modifiers, a mandatory
field type name, and one or more variable declarations. Attributes
are discussed in Section \@ref(AttProg) and you should ignore
field attributes part for now.

Field modifiers include *internal*, *new*,
*private*, *protected*, *public*,
*readonly*, *static*, and *volatile*. The
modifiers *private*, *public*, *protected*,
and *internal* are called *access modifiers*. If you
don't specify an access modifier, *private* is assumed by
default. It is a compile time error to specify more than one
access modifier. However, the combination *protected*
*internal* is allowed. When a field has more than one modifier,
only certain valid combinations are allowed (this restriction is
not shown in the EBNF). The mandatory
field type is the name of a valid built-in or user-defined value
or reference type (not shown in the table). Variable declarations
part consists of one or more variable declarations delimited by a
comma (row 4). A variable declaration is just an identifier name,
or an identifier name followed by the equal (=) symbol and a
variable initializer (row 5). The latter is an expression  or a
array initializer. Array initializers are discussed in
Sections \@ref(OneDArrays) and \@ref(MultDimArrays).

This may look overwhelming and there is no need to get concerned.
Some concrete examples of field declarations are shown in lines 6
-- 13 of FieldsApp.cs program (Listing \@ref(FldDclMod). The
point we want to make here is that it is necessary to precisely
describe the syntax of a program construct so that a compiler has
the requisite knowledge to check for the syntactic correctness of
the program. Moreover, it is easier for you to write syntactically
correct programs once you understand the EBNF rules which specify
their form precisely. Those who lack this type of approach to
learning a programming language find it difficult to learn new
languages. For them, every language is vastly different from the
others.

### Field Modifiers 
As indicated above, commonly used field (access) modifiers include
public, private, protected, and internal. A field with *public* access modifier imposes no
restrictions on who can access and modify its value. Public fields
weaken class encapsulation. On the other hand, the
*private* access modifier restricts the visibility of the
field to the class in which it is defined.In other words, only class members have direct
access (both read and write) to the field. Private access modifier
contributes to class encapsulation. If more general access (i.e.,
access to other types) is desired for a private field, explicit
*get* and *set* accessor methods are provided. They
facilitate enforcing *business rules*, which govern the
assignment and modification of field values.


If a field has *protected* access modifier, it is
accessible to the members of the class. Let us call this class
$A.$ The field is also accessible to the members of the derived
class(es) $D$ of $A.$ The field visibility also extends to the
class(es) derived from $D$, and so on recursively.A field's visibility is restricted to a
compilation unit such as an *assembly* (see
Section \@ref(Assembly)) by using the *internal* access
modifier. A field can also have
additional modifiers: static, constant, and readonly. Static
fields are indicated by including the *static* modifier in
their declaration (line 13, Listing \@ref(FldDclMod)). The
*const* keyword is used to indicate that the field is a
constant --- constant field. The value of a constant field is set at the
compile time and remains constant for the duration of the program.
The value must be written as a literal, or as an expression which
can be evaluated at compile time (lines 8 -- 10). Constant fields
are static by default.


Consider the scenario where you want a field to behave like a
constant but its value is not known at compile time. Once the
field is initialized during the run time, its value cannot be
changed thereafter. Such fields are called readonly fields and the
modifier *readonly* is used as part of their specification.
The initialization of a readonly field is done in the constructor or *variable
initializer*.


Let us revisit FieldsApp.cs program (Listing \@ref(FldDclMod),
which demonstrates programming with fields with different
modifiers. The corresponding class diagram is shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FieldsAppClsDiagram). It has two classes:
FieldsCls and FieldsClsTest. FieldsCls defines several fields:
$p$, a public field of type *int* (line 6); $q$, a public
field of type *float* (line 7); $r$, a public constant
field of type *int* initialized to 5 (line 8); $s$, a
public constant field of type *int* initialized with the
expression $r + 10$ (line 9); $PI$, a public constant field of
type *double* initialized to 3.14159 (line 10); $x$ and
$y$, two public readonly fields of type *int*, and $y$ is
initialized to 5 (line 11); $id$, a private field of type
*int* (line 12); and finally *count*, a public
static field of type *int*. If the value of $r$ is not
defined prior to line 9, compiler will not be able to evaluate the
expression $r+10$ and thus flag an error at line 9. Note that the
static fields and static methods are shown underlined in the class
diagram. FieldsCls class has three methods: FieldsCls(), a
constructor; get and set accessor methods for the $id$ field. Note
the initialization of the readonly field $x$ in the constructor
method (line 17).

Next consider the class FieldsClsTest. Line 33 prints out the
values of $r,s,$ and $PI.$ Recall that these three fields are
constants and are static by default. Therefore, they can be
accessed by using the class name (e.g., FieldsCls.r). Likewise,
*count* (which is a public, static field) can be accessed
and manipulated directly by using the class name as shown in lines
35 -- 36. Accessing and manipulating instance fields (i.e., those
that are not marked static) can only be done through a class
instance. Line 38 creates an instance of FieldsCls named $mc.$
Using $mc,$ fields $p$ and $q$ are initialized with values 100 and
10.75F (lines 41 -- 42). The results of running FieldsApp.cs are
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:FieldsAppOut). The output of line 43
confirms the values of $p,$ $q,$ $x,$ and $y$. Observe that the
new value of $x$ is 10 (set in the constructor). Instance fields
which are private can be accessed and manipulated only by invoking
the associated accessor methods on an instance as shown in line
45. Line 46 prints out the new value of the $id$ field.
