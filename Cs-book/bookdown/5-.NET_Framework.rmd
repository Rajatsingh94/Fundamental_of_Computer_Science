# The .NET Framework {#DotNet}
Microsoft's .NET Framework is a new model for building integrated,
service-oriented applications in the highly distributed
environment of the Internet. A primary goal of the .NET Framework
is to facilitate building applications that gather information
from, and interact with, a wide variety of data sources and
applications in a way that transcends programming languages and
platform dependencies. However, it currently supports only Windows
family of operating systems with possibility of supporting
non-Microsoft operating systems in the future. The framework is
also the solution to Microsoft's strategy for delivering software
as a service. Objectives for this chapter are to:

    - Describe the goals of the .NET Framework.
    - Discuss the building blocks of the .NET Framework.
    - Explain the anatomy of a .NET assembly.
    - Describe the steps in the .NET managed execution process.
    - Explain the notion of .NET namespaces and introduce important namespeces.
    - Introduce various tools and utilities that are part of the Visual Studio.NET and .NET SDK.
    - Illustrate developing programs using the Visual Studio.NET Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    - Illustrate debugging programs using the Visual Studio.NET debugger.

## Goals of the .NET Framework {#DotNetGoals}
The .NET Framework was designed to meet four primary goals:
unifying programming models; supporting extensible,
component-based development; integrating with Web standards and
practices; and making applications development simpler and easier.

Prior to the advent of the .NET, there existed multiple
programming models in the Microsoft realm. Selection of a
programming model was often closely tied to a programming language
and class libraries. However, various programming models are
required in developing practical applications (e.g., one model for
Web page generation, another for database access and manipulation,
yet another for graphics). These programming models also provided
inconsistent functionality for problems that are common to the
models. They also impose steep learning curve for programmers
--- skills in one model don't necessarily translate into skills
required for using other models. The .NET Framework was designed
to unify these disparate programming models.

The Framework is designed as a set of distinct, functional units
that enable a high degree of customization and extensibility.
Almost all the classes in the library can be extended using
inheritance. Furthermore, classes developed in one .NET language
can be used as base classes in another .NET language and extended
via inheritance. Web standards and practices --- HyperText Markup
Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and Simple
Object Access protocol (SOAP) --- are well integrated into the
Framework to facilitate distributed application development in the
Web environment.

Application development is made easier by the high level of
abstraction manifested in the Framework library's Application
Programming Interface (API). The API exposes usage-oriented
functionality from the developers perspective rather than in terms
of the details involved in the implementation of the library
classes. This enables you to simply utilize relevant classes in
your application without knowing how the classes have been
implemented.

## Building Blocks of the .NET Framework {#DotNetBlocks}
Figure \@ref(fig:Framework) shows the .NET Framework --- an
infrastructure for the overall .NET Platform. It consists of the
Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the Framework Class Library
(FCL). CLR is comprised of three components: Common Type System
(CTS), Metadata System, and Execution System. FCL comprises of a
base class library (features classes for interfacing with the
operating system, networking, graphics, etc.), classes for
accessing and manipulating various types of data sources, and
classes for developing conventional client/server, Web, and Web
Services applications.

### Common Language Runtime (CLR)
CLR is the foundation of the .NET Framework. The CTS supports many
of the types and operations found in modern programming languages
such as C++ and Java. The Metadata System persists metadata along
with type information at compile time. This metadata is available
for interrogation by the Execution System and other tools.
Execution System performs code execution and manages execution
runtime environment. Following subsections provides additional
details on CLR components.

```{r Framework, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Building Blocks of the .NET Framework"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/Framework.png")
```
#### Common Type System (CTS)
CTS is a formal specification that defines how types are declared,
used, and managed during the runtime. In the .NET world, the term
*type* is generic and refers to classes, structures,
interfaces, enumerations, and delegates. Fields, events, methods,
properties, and nested types make up members of a type.


CTS supports two generic categories of types: *value* and
*reference* (see Figure \@ref(fig:ValRefTypes). Value types
directly contain their data. Variables that are value types have
their own copies of data. Hence, operations on one value type
variable do not affect the values of other variables. Instances of
value types are allocated on the stack or inline in a structure.
Value types can be built-in, or user-defined structures and
enumerations. Value types derive from System.ValueType class and
are shown in Table \@ref(tab:DataTypes). Column 3 of
Table \@ref(fig:ValRefTypes) shows the range of values that can be
stored in the value types.

```{r DataTypes, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

options(knitr.table.format = "html") 


library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# create column 1 vector
System_Type <- c("System.Byte", "System.SByte", "System.Int16","System.Int32","System.Int64","System.UInt16","System.UInt32","System.UInt64","System.Single","System.Double","System.Boolean","System.Char","System.Decimal")

# create column 2 vector
Description <- c("An 8-bit unsigned integer","An 8-bit signed integer (not CLS complaint)","A 16-bit signed integer","A 32-bit signed integer","A 64-bit signed integer","A 16-bit unsigned integer (not CLS complaint)","A 32-bit unsigned integer (not CLS complaint)","A 64-bit unsigned integer (not CLS complaint)","A single-precision (32-bit) floating-point number","A double-precision (64-bit) floating-point number","A Boolean value (true or false)","A Unicode (16-bit) character","A 96-bit decimal value")
# create data frame
Datatype <- data.frame(System_Type,Description, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library(knitr)

kable(Datatype, caption = "The .NET value types") %>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

#### Metadata System
Metadata is data about types and assemblies. It describes types,
members, and references to other components in the code. Metadata
makes types and assemblies self-describing. CLR checks this
metadata to insure correct runtime execution of code --- to locate
referenced classes, create object instances in memory, resolve
method invocations, generate native code, enforce security, and
determine run-time context boundaries.



Metadata is automatically generated by the compiler and persisted.
For most programmers, focus should be on using and manipulating
the metadata. Inspecting a type's metadata at runtime is called
*reflection*. FCL provides several classes to support
reflection. Alternatively, you can use Intermediate Language
Disassembler (ILDASM) tool for examining metadata. ILDASM is
discussed in Section \@ref(DotNetUtilities). Facilities also
exist for creating your own metadata using *custom attributes*,
which are discussed in Section \@ref(AttProg).

#### Execution System
The Execution System (or runtime system) can be viewed as an agent
that manages code at execution time, providing core services such
as memory and thread management, and remoting. It also enforces
strict type safety and other forms of code accuracy to insure
application security and robustness.

Code that is developed with language compilers and tools that
target the CLR is known as *managed code*, whereas the code
that does not target the CLR is known as *unmanaged code*.
Managed code benefits from features such as: cross-language
integration --- code developed using different languages can be
seamlessly intermixed; cross-language exception handling ---
exceptions raised in code developed using a .NET language can be
detected and handled by code developed in other .NET languages;
enhanced security; versioning and deployment support --- multiple
versions of a piece of code can co-exist and run without
interference; a simplified model for component interaction;
debugging and profiling services.


The runtime handles object layout in memory and manages references
to objects, releasing them when they are no longer in use ---
memory management. Objects whose lifetimes are managed in this
manner by the runtime are called *managed data*. This
automatic memory management resolves the two most common
application errors: *memory leaks* and *invalid
memory references*.

### Framework Class Library (FCL)
The .NET Framework provides an extensive library consisting of
fully implemented classes, interfaces, and value types which is
available to all .NET-aware (or CLS-compliant) programming
languages. The library is referred to as the Framework Class
Library (FCL). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Framework), FCL
includes: base class library --- core base classes (graphics,
threading, security, debugging, networking, code
internationalization); classes for database access and
manipulation, creating and processing XML documents; classes for
building Web-based, Windows-based, and Web Services applications,
among others. To facilitate interoperability between languages,
FCL library types are CLS-compliant.

### Common Language Specification (CLS)
The Common Language Specification defines a minimal and basic set
of language features that developers can rely on being available
in a wide variety of languages. In essence, the CLS defines a
baseline to which all .NET-aware languages are expected to
conform. The CLS rules define a subset of the CTS rules. CLS plays
an important role in ensuring language interoperability. If the
API exposed by a software component is CLS-compliant, the
component is guaranteed to be accessible from any programming
language that supports CLS. Note that the CLS rules apply only to
the exposed API of a component, and not to the code used to build
its inner workings.

A programming language whose compiler targets CLR is known as a
*.NET-aware* programming language. Such compilers generate
Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and associated metadata.

## Assemblies: The Building Blocks of the .NET Framework {#Assembly}
Assemblies are the building blocks of applications built using the
.NET Framework. An assembly is a logical unit of functionality
from deployment view point. It is a versioned, self-describing
binary unit. An assembly is either a library file (with .dll file
extension) or stand alone executable (with .exe file extension).
It encompasses: name, originator, and version information;
configuration and culture information; a list of types (classes,
interfaces, structures, enumerations, and delegates) and their
locations in the assembly; and resources (e.g., bitmaps). Version
numbers are used to differentiate between versions of an assembly.
Version number consists of: major version, minor version, build
number, and revision number.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Assembly), an assembly (in general)
consists of four elements: assembly manifest, type metadata, MSIL,
and a set of resources. An assembly manifest describes the
assembly's contents --- metadata about an assembly. It establishes
the namespace for resolving requests for types. It also determines
which types are accessible only from within the assembly, and
which types are exported (i.e., available for use by other
assemblies). The manifest may also specify which security
permissions are required to run, which additional permissions are
optionally requested, and which permissions the assembly refuses.

Type metadata describes information about a type. For example,
metadata about a class includes its fields, properties, methods,
delegates, indexers as well as detailed information such as method
access modifiers, number and type of parameters, and return types.
Type metadata is essential for discovering type information at
runtime and dynamic method invocation. It is used by compilers,
debugging tools, CLR, and other tools. MSIL is
computer-independent representation of programs written in
.NET-aware languages. MSIL is subsequently converted into
computer-specific instructions using a Just-In-Time (JIT)
compiler. Resources include bitmaps, and audio and video clips
that are used in the program.

An assembly performs the following functions:

    - It contains the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code
      that the CLR executes. Assemblies are stored as Portable
      Executable (PE) files. PE is a format for storing executable
      files.
      
    - It forms a *type boundary*. The identity of each type
      residing in the assembly includes the name of the assembly.
      Therefore, a type called *ClassA* residing in the scope of
      one assembly is not the same as a type called *ClassA*
      residing in the scope of another assembly.
    
    - It forms a *security boundary* as it is the unit at
      which permissions are requested and granted.
       
    - It forms a *reference scope boundary*. Recall that
      assembly manifest contains assembly metadata: describes the types
      and resources residing in the assembly, the types and resources
      visible outside the assembly, and the other assemblies on which it
      depends.
      
    - It forms a *version boundary*. An assembly is a
      smallest versionable unit. All types and resources contained in an
      assembly are versioned as a unit. The assembly's manifest also
      includes version information for the assemblies it depends on.
      
    - It forms a *deployment unit*. When an application
      starts, it retrieves only the assemblies that are needed. Other
      assemblies of the application are loaded as and when needed. This
      helps in starting an application small, thin, and fast.
      
    - It enables *side-by-side execution* --- is the
      ability to run multiple versions of the same assembly
      simultaneously without interference from each other. Since
      assemblies are versioned and self-describing, they allow for
      side-by-side execution.
      
```{r Assembly, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Contents of a typical .NET assembly"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/Assembly.png")
```
    
### Single- and Multi-file Assemblies
There are two types of assemblies depending on how the assemblies
are produced. We can group all the elements into a single physical
file resulting in a *single-file assembly*, which is also
referred to as *single-module assembly*. Alternatively, the
elements of an assembly can be contained in several files
resulting in a *multi-file assembly*, which is also known
as *multi-module assembly*. The files of a multi-file
assembly can be modules of compiled code (.netmodule), resources
(such as .bmp or .jpg files), or other files required by the
application. Multi-file assemblies are created when you want to
combine modules written in different languages and to optimize
downloading an application by putting seldom used types in a
module that is downloaded on a as-needed basis. Multi-file
assemblies are built using the csc.exe (i.e., C\# compiler) or the
assembly linker tool (al.exe). For additional details on
generating multi-module assemblies, you should consult the online
documentation.

### Static and Dynamic Assemblies
An assembly can be *static* or *dynamic*. Static
assemblies are stored on disk as PE files. Static assemblies
include built-in .NET FCL types, resources, and other assemblies
created using development tools such as Visual Studio.NET. In
contrast, dynamic assemblies are created at runtime and later run
directly from memory. You can save dynamic assemblies to disk
after they have executed. Dynamic assemblies are created using
classes in the Reflection.Emit namespace.

### Private and Shared Assesmblies
An assembly can be private or shared. A *private assembly*
is used only by the application with which it has been deployed.
Private assemblies are required to be located in the application
directory (i.e., the main directory of the owning application) or
a subdirectory thereof. *Shared assemblies* are used by
several applications/clients on a single machine and are installed
into a machine-wide Global Assembly Cache (GAC). Assemblies that
are shipped with the .NET Framework are shared and are found in
GAC. The GAC itself is located under
$\backslash$Windows$\backslash$assembly directory (for WindowsXP).
Shared assemblies are installed into GAC using
*gacutil.exe* tool. For example, the following command adds
a shared assembly named MethodsBasics.dll to GAC: 

gacutil.exe -i MethodBasics.dll.

You can also view and manipulate the contents of GAC using the
Windows Explorer. To view GAC contents, navigate to:
$\backslash$Windows$\backslash$assembly directory. To add an
assembly to GAC using Windows Explorer, just drag and drop the
assembly file into this directory. To delete an assembly, select
the name, right-click, and choose *Delete* option from the
resulting pop-up menu.

An assembly always has a simple name, but an assembly deployed in
GAC must have a *strong name* so that different versions of
an assembly can be running at the same time for different client
applications. Strong names guarantee name uniqueness and
facilitate what is called *side-by-side execution* ---
different versions of the same application can run in parallel
without affecting their respective execution environments.


A strong name consists of the assembly's identity: its simple text
name, version number, and culture information (if provided), a
public key and a digital signature. Shared assemblies are signed
with a strong name. To build a shared or strong-named assembly,
you must first generate a public-private key pair using the .Net
Framework utility called Strong Name (sn.exe) tool. For example,
to generate a key pair and store it in file MyKey.snk, you need to
issue the following command:

sn.exe -k MyKey.snk

Once the public-private key pair is generated, an assembly can be
signed with the generated key file using the attribute
AssemblyKeyFileAttribute in any one of the source files. The
following statement specifies that the assembly must be signed
using the key file MyFile.snk: 

[assembly: AssemblyKeyFileAttribute ("MyKey.snk")]

When this attributes specified, the compiler takes care of signing
the assembly with the specified key pair. You can also sign an
assembly using the Assembly Linker tool (al.exe) with -keyfile
switch. For additional details, you should consult the online
documentation.


## Managed Execution Process {#ExecProcess}
The managed execution process in .NET describes the steps required
to take advantage of the CLR. As shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:ManagedExecProcess), it includes the following
steps:

1. *Choosing a compiler*. To take advantage of the CLR,
   your source code must be written in a language with a compiler
   that targets the .NET runtime. Currently, these languages include
   C\#, Visual Basic .NET, Managed Visual C++, and JScript.

1. *Compiling source code into MSIL*. A .NET language
   compiler translates the source code into Microsoft Intermediate
   Language (MSIL). MSIL is a CPU-independent set of instructions
   that can be converted into machine-specific native code. MSIL
   corresponding to the \textit{Factorial} method in
   Listing \@ref(tab:DebugDemoApp) is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:MSIL).
   Along with MSIL, the compiler also produces assembly manifest and
   other metadata (see Figure \@ref(fig:ILDASM). The MSIL and
   metadata are stored in a portable executable (PE) file whose
   format is based on Microsoft PE and Common Object File Format
   (COFF). The presence of metadata along with MSIL is what makes the
   code self-describing.

1. *Compiling MSIL into native code*. The MSIL must be
   converted into native code of the machine where the code is to be
   executed. A JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is used to convert MSIL
   into CPU-specific code. The JIT compiler converts MSIL as and when
   needed and stores the resulting native code for subsequent use. As
   a part of this conversion, the MSIL and metadata go through a
   verification process. This process examines the MSIL and metadata
   to find out whether the code is type safe and is known to access
   only the memory locations it is allowed to access.

1. *Executing native code*. The native code is managed and
   executed by the CLR runtime. During execution, the managed code
   benefits from CLR services such as automatic memory management,
   security, interoperability with unmanaged code, and support for
   cross-language debugging, deployment, and versioning.

```{r ManagedExecProcess, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Managed Execution Process in .NET"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/ManagedExecProcess.png")
```


## Application Domains {#AppDoms}
Typically several applications concurrently run on a computer.
Resources such as memory and processor time are shared among these
applications in a way that applications run without interfering
with each other in an obtrusive manner. To effect this isolation
of concurrently executing applications from each other, operating
systems and language runtime environments typically provide some
mechanism. *Application domains* is such a mechanism for
.NET applications.


A *process* is an application or program in execution. In
includes the executable code and the resources needed to execute
the code. Traditionally, a separate process is created for each
application. A process is not allowed to execute instructions
outside the process boundary. Processes entail resource and other
overheads. Operating systems are responsible for ensuring process
isolation.


In .NET, you can run several application domains in a single
process with the same level of isolation that would exist in
separate processes, but without incurring the additional overhead.
The benefits of the isolation provided by application domains
include:

    - Defects in one application cannot affect other applications.
    - Individual applications can be stopped without stopping the entire process.
    - Code running in one application cannot directly access code or resources from another application.
    - Permissions granted to code can be controlled by the application domain in which the code is running.


```{r MSIL, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Microsoft Intermediate Language sample"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/MSIL.png")
```


You must first load an assembly into an application domain before
the application can be run. Running a typical application causes
several other assemblies to be loaded into an application domain
behind the scenes. An assembly is said to be
*domain-neutral* when its code can be shared by all domains
in the process. The runtime system decides whether to load
assemblies as domain-neutral when it loads the runtime into a
process.


## Namespace and the FLC class {#DotNetNameSpaces}
In .NET, the concept of namespaces is used to organize code and to
define a scope for types (classes, structures, enumerations,
delegates, and interfaces). When relevant types are grouped into a
namespace, you avoid possible name clashes when two types with the
same name are used in a program. With the use of namespaces, two
types with the same name can be used in a program provided they
are in different namespaces and the types are qualified with the
appropriate namespace. The namespace name is part of the
*fully qualified name* of the type and takes the form:
*namespaceName.typeName*.

All namespaces in .NET that are shipped by Microsoft begin with
one of the two names: System or Microsoft. An overview of some of
the namespaces included in .NET is listed below:

1. System: Contains fundamental core classes that deal with commonly used value and
   reference types, mathematical manipulation, garbage collection, events and event handlers,
   interfaces, attributes, and exception handling.

1. System.Collections: Contains classes and interfaces to work with collections of objects,
   such as queues, stacks, lists, bit arrays, hashtables, and dictionaries.

1. System.Data: Contains classes that define ADO.NET architecture which enables efficient
   management of data from multiple data sources.
   
1. System.Data.Common: Contains classes common to all .NET data providers. A .NET
   data provider defines a collection of classes used to access a data source.
   
1. System.Data.OleDb: Defines classes for OLE DB .NET data provider.

1. Microsoft.Data.Odbc: Defines classes for ODBC .NET data provider.

1. System.Data.SqlClient: Defines classes for SQL Server .NET data provider.

1. System.Data.OracleClient: Defines classes for Oralce .NET data provider.

1. System.Diagnostics: Contains classes to interact with system processes, event logs,
   tracing, debugging, and performance counters. 
   
1. System.Drawing: Contains classes that provide graphics functionality.

1. System.Globalization: Contains classes that define culture-related information such as
   language, currency, date, calendars, etc.

1. System.IO: Contains types for input/output (I/O) manipulation of streams and files.

1. System.Messaging: Contains classes to work with message queues.

1. System.Net: Provides classes for network programming.

1. System.Reflection: Contains classes that support runtime type discovery.

1. System.Runtime.Remoting: Provides types that allow developers to create and configure
   distributed applications.
   
1. System.Security: Contains classes that deal with security, permissions, cryptography,etc.

1. System.Threading: Provides classes and interfaces needed for multithreaded programming.

1. System.Web: Contains classes and interfaces that enable browser/server communication,
   cookie manipulation, output cache control, etc.

1. System.Web.Services: Consists of classes used to build and use web services.

1. System.Windows.Forms: Contains classes for creating Windows-based form applications.

1. System.Xml: Contains classes that can be used to create and manipulate XML documents.

```


## Framework Utilities {#DotNetUtilities}
The .NET Framework and Visual Studio.NET provide many useful tools or utilities which
can be used to view the contents of an assembly (DLL or EXE), dump assembly contents to
a file, and browse definitions of namespaces and classes. This section briefly describes some
of these tools.


### IL Disassembler Utility
The Intermediate Language Disassembler utility (ILDasm.exe) is
used to view the contents of an assembly (DLL or EXE). You can
display assembly manifest, IL instructions, and type metadata.
Figure \@ref(fig:ILDASM) shows the contents of an assembly named
DebugDemoApp.exe (corresponding to
Listing \@ref(DebugDemoApp).

Once an assembly is opened with ILDasm.exe tool, you can view the
assembly's manifest by double-clicking the MANIFEST node in the
panel. This launches a separate window displaying the assembly
manifest. You can display the IL (Figure \@ref(fig:MSIL) for
methods and fields of types contained in the assembly by
double-clicking the appropriate node in the tree
(Figure \@ref(fig:ILDASM). You can dump the IL for an assembly by
selecting *File* $\vert$ *Dump* menu item and
providing a file name for the *.il file ^[The notation
\textsl{File* $\vert$ \textsl{Dump* refers to first clicking on
File menu item on the menu bar and clicking on Dump submenu item
in the resulting dropdown.]. You can also dump hierarchical
organization of types in an assembly by selecting *File*
$\vert$ *Dump TreeView* menu item and providing a file name
for the *.txt file. You can view the type metadata by pressing
CTRL+M (i.e., simultaneously pressing control and M keys on the
keyboard).

```

### Window Class Viewer Utility
The Windows Class Viewer (WinCV.exe) tool is used to browse the
definitions of types provided in the FCL. Figure \@ref(fig:WINCV)
shows a sample screenshot of WinCV.exe. Enter the name of the type
you wish to explore in the top textbox and its definition is
displayed in the right-hand side pane. You can also copy the
displayed contents to the clipboard for later use.

### ClassBrowser Web Application

The ClassBrowser is a sample web application that comes with the
.NET Software Development Kit (SDK) that can be used to explore
.NET namespaces. Once the .NET SDK samples are installed, you can
find this application in the directory C:\verb+\+Program
Files\verb+\+Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
2003\verb+\+SDK\verb+\+v1.1\verb+\+QuickStart\verb+\+aspplus\verb+\+samples\verb+\+classbrowser.
You launch the application by navigating to \\
http://localhost/QuickStart/aspplus/samples/classbrowser/cs/classbrowser.aspx.
You need to have Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
installed on your computer to run this application.
Figure \@ref(fig:ClassBrowser) shows a sample screenshot of this
application. Click on a namespace in the left pane to see the
various classes in that namespace displayed in the right pane. By
clicking on a class name, you can see detailed class information
--- properties, fields, and methods.

### Visual Studio .NET Object Browser
Visual Studio.NET also provides an object browser. This browser
allows you to explore namespaces and types within them. You can
access this utility from the \textsl{View} $\vert$ *Other Windows*
$\vert$ *Object Browser* menu item.
Figure \@ref(fig:ObjectBrowser) shows screenshot of the Object
Browser when invoked when a project is open in the IDE. Invoking
the Object Browser from IDE without a open project doesn't display
anything.

## Developing Programs Using Visual Studio.Net {#DotNetIDE}
In this section, we show you how to use the Visual Studio.NET's
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing programs.
It currently supports four primary .NET-aware programming
languages: C\#, Visual Basic.NET, Managed C++, and JScript.NET.
Start Visual Studio.NET by executing the following menu selection
sequence: *Start* $\vert$ *All Programs* $\vert$
*Microsoft Visual Studio.NET* $\vert$ *Visual
Studio.NET*. If you have a desktop shortcut to this program, you
can start the IDE by double-clicking the shortcut icon. You should
now see the IDE start window similar to the one shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE1).

What is shown at startup depends on the options you have selected
in the IDE for *At Startup* dropdown as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE2). You can access this window by selecting
*Tools* $\vert$ *Options*$\cdots$ menu. As shown in
the figure, you have four choices for *At Startup*
dropdown: Show Start Page, Load last loaded solution, Show Open
Project dialog box, Show New Project dialog box, and Show empty
environment. The startup window shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE1)
corresponds to the *Show Start Page* option. The
*Projects* tab of this window lists projects that you have
worked on and dates they were last modified. *Find Samples*
tab allows you to search for sample projects that are packaged
with .NET SDK. These sample projects are useful quick starts
--- you can pattern your projects based on a relevant
sample project. Clicking the buttons labeled *Open Project*
and *New Project* bring up dialog boxes for opening an
existing project and creating a new project.

```{r ObjectBrowser, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Visual Studio.NET Object Browser"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/ObjectBrowser.png")
```



```{r IDE1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Visual Studio.NET startup window"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE1.png")
```

```{r IDE2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Visual Studio.NET startup window options"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE2.png")
```


Let us create a new project by clicking on the *New
Project* button, which brings up the window shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE3). In the top left pane labeled
*Project Types:*, click on *Visual C\# Projects*
folder and in the top right pane labeled *Templates:*,
click on *Console Application* icon (you may have to scroll
down to see this icon). In the textbox labeled *Name:*,
type StudentApp (this is the name of the project you are
creating). You also type in a location (i.e., directory path) for
storing this project in the textbox labeled *Location:*; in
our case it is:

*C:$\backslash$FundCS1$\backslash$DotNetFramework$\backslash$ProjSol*.

Alternatively, you can specify the directory path by clicking on
the *Browse*$\cdots$ button and navigating to the desired
directory. Next click on the *OK* button to complete the
new project creation process. Now your IDE should look like the
window shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE4). The heavy ellipse in the
top of the window is added as an annotation using a graphics
editing program to illustrate a point later on. Therefore, you
 wouldn't see the ellipse in your window. Code shown in the left
 pane is created by default: a class named
*Class1* with one method (named *Main*).

The IDE is in the *design* mode as indicated by the
presence of the word *design* in the window title
(Figure \@ref(fig:IDE4)). Below the window title is the
*menu bar* which lists the top-level menu items: File,
Edit, View, Project, etc. Below the menu bar are three toolbars
named *Standard*, *Text Editor*, and *Debug*.
A toolbar is a collection of graphic icons linearly arranged. Each
icon provides a specific functionality but the functionality of
various icons on a toolbar is complementary in solving a problem.
For example, *Standard* toolbar (the one right below the
menu bar) features functionality which is common to all projects:
creating a project, adding an item to an existing project, opening
and saving files, cut, copy, paste, etc.

An important point to notice on the *Standard Toolbar* is a
dropdown, for which the value *Debug* is shown (circled in
red) in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE4). When you compile in debug mode, in
addition to an EXE file, a *pdb* file is also created. The
*pdb* file contains necessary information for debugging
your program (discussed in Section \@ref(IDEDebugger)). You can
also compile in *Release* mode, in which case only an EXE
file is produced. Release mode optimizes the program for efficient
execution and is typically used when the program is ready for
production use or deployment. Debug mode is used in the
development stages of the program. Below the *Standard*
toolbar is *Text Editor* toolbar, which provides
language-specific or syntax-aware editing help in creating your
program text --- commenting and uncommenting a block of code,
increasing and decreasing indentation, bookmark creation and quick
navigation using the bookmarks. Below the *Text Editor*
toolbar is *Debug* toolbar, which is discussed in
Section \@ref(IDEDebugger).

```{r IDE3, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Visual Studio.NET new project creation window"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE3.png")
```

Visual Studio.NET IDE comes with an array of toolbars, which can
be displayed or removed from the IDE by selecting from the
*View* $\vert$ *Toolbars* menu. By placing the mouse
cursor on any toolbar icon displays its function. This form of
displaying help is referred to as *tooltip*. Display
*Solution Explorer* by selecting *View* $\vert$
*Solution Explorer* menu. Now your window should look
similar to the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE5). If you don't
see *Properties* window, display it by selecting
*View* $\vert$ *Properties Window* menu (keyboard
shortcut is F4). *Solution Explorer* window shows the
structure of your solution. Typically a solution consists of
several projects, and a project consists of several components
(e.g., code and resource files).


Shown in *Solution Explorer* window in
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE5) is a solution named *StudentApp*,
which has one project named *StudentApp* (indicated in bold
face). The project has four components: References (other
components on which this project is dependent), App.ico (an
application icon, which is a resource), AssemblyInfo.cs (file in
which assembly information is kept), and Class.cs (C\# source code
file). To see properties of an item in the *Solution
Explorer* window, click on it and its properties are shown in the
*Properties* window. In summary, *Solution Explorer*
provides a hierarchical view of a solution.

```{r IDE4, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Debug mode compilation in Visual Studio.NET"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE4.png")
```

Next display *Class View* window by selecting *View*
$\vert$ *Class View* menu. Your window should look like the
one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE6). You may have to expand the
items (prefixed with +) to make your window look like
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE6). *Class View* window shows your
solution from a class perspective. What is shown in the window is
the project name (StudentApp), a namespace (named StudentApp with
$\{\}$ prefix, classes within this namespace
(just Class1 in our example), and members of the class Class1.
Class members include Bases and Interfaces (ignore this for now)
and the Main() method.


To conserve space in IDE, you can *auto hide* solution
explorer, class view, index, and properties windows by pressing
the *push pin* icon on the window. Push pin icon is the one
to the left of $\times$ icon (located in top rightmost window
corner). When an item is in auto hide, a miniature icon
representing the item is shown adjacent to the right edge of the
IDE window. In Figure \@ref(fig:IDE5), *Class View* is in
*auto hide*. When you position the mouse cursor on Class
View auto hide icon, Class View is displayed. When the cursor
moves outside the boundary of Class View, the latter is
automatically put in auto hide.

Essence of our StudentApp project is the code shown in
Listing \@ref(StudentApp). Enter this code into the code pane.
If the code already exists in a file you can add the code as
follows. Assume that the code is in a file named Student.cs.
Delete the file by right clicking on Class1.cs item in the Class
View window and select *Delete* option from the resulting
pop-up menu. Copy Student.cs file into the project directory.
Select *File* $\vert$ *Add Existing Item*$\cdots$
menu and navigate \textit{File Dialog Box* to the project
directory (if necessary) and click on Student.cs and then on the
*Open* button. Though it is not necessary to keep the code
file Student.cs in the project directory, it is a good practice to
keep the all the files in the project directory or subdirectories
of the project directory. Otherwise, it is common for many to
delete a file since its context is not apparent and realize the
mistake when it is too late.

```{r IDE5, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Solution Explorer and Properties windows"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE5.png")
```

```{r IDE6, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Class View window"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE6.png")
```


```{r IDE7, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="StudentApp.cs listing in IDE"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE7.png")
```

Notice the vertical line in the code pane to the left of the code.
The line has little square shapes (or nodes) placed on it
corresponding to the beginning line of namespaces, classes, and
methods. These shapes have $-$ inscribed in them. Clicking on a
node folds the corresponding method code into one line. A small
rectangle with $\cdots$ inscribed in it is appended to the line
and $-$ in the square is turned into $+$. Clicking on a folded
node unfolds the node by showing the code; and $+$ in the square
is turned into $-$. Now fold the nodes corresponding to
TestStudent class, and GetId and GetName methods. Your IDE should
look like the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE7). Folding and
unfolding of code is useful to view your code at various levels
--- namespace, class, method. At the highest level, your code is
just one or more namespaces. Namespaces can be expanded to view
its constituent types; types can be expanded to view their
members. This feature is especially helpful for large programs
consisting of several classes.

If you have added the code via *File* $\vert$ *Add*
*Existing Item*$\cdots$ menu, you may have to expand the nodes in
the *Class View* window and double-click on a class to see
the corresponding code in the left pane. You can also view the
corresponding code by double-clicking the file in the Solution
Explorer.

```{r IDE8, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Wizard for adding a class method"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE8.png")
```

Code can also be added interactively using wizards. For example,
you can add a method to *Student* class of
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE7) by right-clicking on the class name (in the
Class View window) and selecting *Add* menu from the
resulting popup, and finally selecting the type of class member
(e.g., method, property, field, indexer). *Add Method*
wizard is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE8). The wizard allows you to
specify method access (e.g., public, private, protected), method
name, return type, parameter lists, among others.


Notice the two dropdowns right above the code pane. The left one
shows various types in the code in your project or solution. In
our example, we have two classes: Student and TestStudent. If you
select a specific type (for example, Student class), the right
dropdown shows all the members of this type. These dropdowns are
very effective to quickly zoom into a specific part of the code
without the drudgery of scrolling the code pane.

Compile the source code by selecting *Build* $\vert$
*Build Solution* menu option. The results of compilation
(success or failure and related details) are displayed in a new
window titled *Output* right under the code pane. You can
close the *Output* window by clicking on $\times$ symbol on
the top rightmost corner of the window.

Now remove the semicolon at the end of line 27\footnote{How to
display code line numbers in IDE is discussed in
Section \@ref(IDEDebugger). (Listing \@ref(StudentApp).
IDE immediate places a red $\sim$ at the place of the semicolon
signalling that there is possibly a syntax problem at this
location. Go ahead and compile the program. As expected, the
program doesn't compile and the errors are reported in a window
titled *Task List* right under the code pane as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:IDE9). Clicking on a syntax error takes you to the
line in the code pane that is suspected of causing the error.
Correct the error by typing the semicolon back in its original
place. Compile the program. Execute it by selecting the menu
option *Debug* $\vert$ *Start Without Debugging*.
The output will be displayed in a command prompt window.

```{r IDE9, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Removing syntax errors in Visual Studio.NET IDE"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE9.png")
```

On-line help is an extremely important source of information that
you rely on to advance your knowledge of C\# and .NET. Selecting
*Help* $\vert$ *Index*$\cdots$ displays
*Index* window. Typing System.String in the *Look for:* 
textbox displays help topics relevant to System.String in
the pane under *Filtered by:* dropdown. Click on
*System.String class* topic and you will see detailed
description about the class as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:IDE10).
Seeking help online is the only efficient way to get to the
information very quickly since C\# and .NET documentation is vast.



## Visual Studio .NET GUI Debugger {#IDEDebugger}
You should read Section \@ref(DebugStrategies) (you may omit
discussion on cordbg.exe --- a command-line debugger) before
reading this section. Visual Studio.NET debugger is a visual tool
for debugging C\# programs. To illustrate the features of this
debugger, we employ the same program used for illustrating the
command line debugger: DebugDemoApp.cs
(Listing \@ref(DebugDemoApp)). Select *Tools* $\vert$
*Options* menu to display the window shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:StudioLinenumbers). In the left column pane, click
on the folder labeled *Text Editor* to expand it.  Under
the *Text Editor* folder, click on the subfolder labeled
*C\#*. Select the checkbox labeled *Line numbers* in
the lower right side of the window area. Now you should see line
numbers for the source code as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:StudioBreakpoints).

Recall that breakpoints correspond to program statements at which
you would like the program execution be temporarily suspended so
that you can examine the *state* of your program ---
variable and expression values, call stack --- at those
statements. To set breakpoints, simply click on the gray vertical
bar at the left of the window corresponding to a source code
statement. A red circle appears on the gray vertical bar
indicating that the breakpoint has been set.
Figure \@ref(fig:StudioBreakpoints) shows two breakpoints at line
numbers 9 and 23. You can also set a breakpoint by: positioning
the mouse cursor anywhere on a statement and right-clicking the
mouse button, and selecting *Insert Breakpoint* menu from
the resulting popup. Removing breakpoints is just as easy:
clicking on a red circle removes the corresponding breakpoint.
Alternatively, you can remove a breakpoint by right-clicking on a
statement and selecting *Remove Breakpoint* menu from the
resulting popup. Remove the breakpoint at line 9.

```{r IDE10, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Online help in Visual Studio.NET IDE"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/IDE10.png")

knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/StudioBreakpoints.png")
```

Debug* $\vert$ *Start* menu selection starts the
debugger. Alternatively, you can just press the F5 function key on
the keyboard. F5 is a keyboard shortcut for *Debug* $\vert$
*Start* menu selection. Yet you may find using the
*Debug* toolbar more convenient. Use the tooltip feature to
get to know functions of the toolbar icons. To start the debugger,
click on $\blacktriangleright$ icon. Notice that the Visual
Studio.NET IDE has moved into *break* mode from the
*design* mode (as indicated by the presence of the term
*break* in the window title). What submenus and dropdowns
are available for a given menu item is dependent on the IDE mode:
design, or debug.


The screen snapshot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:DebugMenu) is the
result of *Debug* $\vert$ *Windows* $\vert$
*Watch* menu selection. As the figure shows, there are
several debugger commands available in a debug session. Notice the
keyboard shortcuts for some of these commands. For example, F10,
F11, and Shift+F11 (i.e., simultaneously press shift and F11 keys)
are shortcuts for *Step Over*, *Step Into*, and
*Step Out*. Table \@ref(tab:DebugMenu) summarizes some of
these commands. You can stop the debugger by clicking on
$\blacksquare$ icon on the *Debug* toolbar. Alternatively,
you can select *Debug* $\vert$ *Stop Debugger* menu
option (keyboard shortcut Shift+F5) to terminate a debug session.

```{r DebugMenu, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center',fig.cap="Debug menu and its submenus"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/DotNetFramework/Illus/DebugMenu.png")
```

During a debug session, program runtime state information is
available for examination via several debug windows
(*Debug* $\vert$ *Windows* menu selection).
Table \@ref(tab:DebugWindows) explains the purpose or what state
information is available in some of these windows.

If the breakpoints at lines 9 and 23 are not already set, set them
now. Start the debugger by clicking on $\blacktriangleright$ icon
on the *Debug* toolbar. A Console window prompts you for an
integer value. Sometimes, the Console window may appear behind the
Visual Studio.NET window. Enter 5 as input in the Console window.
In debugging console applications, it is necessary to switch
between the Visual Studio.NET and Console windows. The execution
suspends at the breakpoint on line 23. Notice that line 23 is
highlighted with yellow color and there is a right yellow arrow in
the red circle (denoting the breakpoint). Place the mouse cursor
over number (line 21), result (line 18), and obj (line 23)
variables, one at a time, and observe the displayed tooltip (see
Figure \@ref(fig:ViewingVariableValues).

```

Though we didn't explicitly initialize the *result*, it has
been initialized to zero (the C\# compiler has automatically
generated the necessary code for this task). Note that
*obj* is also initialized to *null* --- a special
value used for object initialization just as 0 is used for integer
variables. When an object variable value is *null*, the
object has not been instantiated and we cannot invoke any
operations. Manipulating such objects will result in runtime error
conditions or exceptions. Position the mouse cursor on
*Parse* on line 20. The tooltip displays useful information
about the method --- its signature and functional description.

Now display watch window *Watch 1* by selecting
*Debug* $\vert$ *Windows* $\vert$ *Watch*
$\vert$ *Watch 1* menu option. Alternatively, click the
*hand* icon dropdown on the *Debug* toolbar (the one
to the right of *Hex* icon; it is also the last one on the
toolbar), and select *Watch* $\vert$ *Watch 1* in
the resulting cascading menus. As shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:ViewingVariableValues), Watch 1 window has three
columns: name, value, and type. Enter the expression
*number $>$ 5* under the name column. The debugger
immediately evaluates the expression and displays the value in the
second column. Since the expression (5 $>$ 5) evaluates to
*false*, the second displays this value. The third column
indicates that the expression value is of type *bool*. You
can have several expressions (one per row) in a watch window and
the IDE comes with four predefined windows: Watch 1, Watch 2,
Watch 3, and Watch 4. Watch windows are useful to instantly
evaluate expressions at breakpoints. Close the watch window by
clicking on $\times$ in top right corner of the window.

Continue your debugging session by clicking on *Step Over*
icon on the *Debug* toolbar. The debugger suspends
execution at line 24. Click on *Step Over* again and the
execution stops at line 25. Now place the mouse cursor over
*result* in line 24 and notice that tooltip displays its
value as 120. Notice that *Step Over* treated the call to
Factorial() as one statement. It didn't trace the execution of
Factorial method (lines 7--15). Click on *Step Over* and
the execution stops at line 29, clicking it again terminates the
program. Close the *Output* window beneath the code pane.


Now let us look into how *Step Into* works. Start the
debugger. Execution stops at the breakpoint (line 23). Now
clicking on *Step Into* icon two times in succession
suspends the program execution at line 9 --- the first executable
statement in the Factorial method. Now you can click on either
*Step Into* or *Step Over* and see how the
*for loop* (discussed in Section \@ref(Iteration)) gets
executed. Notice that the statement(s) in the
*initializers* section get executed only once when the
execution control first arrives at the loop. *forCondition*
is evaluated every time before entering the loop body ---
embStmtBlock section. Right after executing the embStmtBlock, the
statement(s) comprising the *forIterator* part are
executed. Open Watch 1 window and type in the expression $i <= n$
in the name column. Observe how the values of *i*,
*fact*, and $i <= n$ change as the execution progresses
through the loop iteration. You can view the values of *i*
and *fact* by three different methods: placing the mouse
cursor over them; via the *Autos* window; entering them as
two separate expression in Watch 1 window as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:MultipleExpressions). Also notice in this figure
that an error is reported for the value the expression
*number $>$ 5* in Watch 1 window. This is because the
variable *number* is defined in Main() and is not visible
(or out of scope) in Parse().

Line 10 has three executable statements, one for each of
*initializers*, *forCondition*, and
*forIterator*. For such lines you can set a breakpoint at a
specific statement by placing the mouse cursor on it,
right-clicking, and selecting *Set Breakpoint* from the
resulting popup menu.


You should experiments with various debugger commands to get a
deeper understanding of their working. Knowing the debugger well
saves you a lot of time and agony. It is often considered as a
best friend of programmers.

## Chapter Summary
The .NET Framework is an object-oriented environment for building
applications in the distributed environment of the Internet. Its
goals include unifying various programming models; supporting
extensible, component-based development; integrating with Web
standards and practices, and making application development
simpler and easier.

At the highest level, Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Framework
Class Library (FCL) comprise the Framework. CLR includes Common
Type System (CTS), Metadata System, and Execution System. CTS is a
formal specification that defines how types are declared, used,
and managed during program execution time. Metadata is data about
types and assemblies, which makes the latter self-describing.
*Reflection* refers to examining the metadata at runtime.
Metadata system generates and manages this data. Execution System
manages code execution by providing services such as memory and
thread management, and remoting.

Code that is developed by language compilers and tools that target
CLR is called *managed code*; the code that doesn't target
CLR is known as *unmanaged code*. Objects whose lifetimes
are managed by the Execution System comprise *managed
data*. Primary benefits of managed data is the elimination of two
most common application errors: *memory leaks* and
*invalid memory references*.


FCL includes base class library (core classes for threading,
security, graphics, network communication); classes for database
and XML data access and manipulation; and classes for developing
conventional client/server, Web-based, and Web Services
applications.


Common Language Specification (CLS) defines a minimal, basic set
of language features that programmers can rely on being available
in a wide variety of lanuages. Languages that conform to the
baseline defined by CLS are referred to as *.NET-aware*
languages. CLS conformance is critical for language
interoperability --- ability to compose an application using
several pieces of code, each of which is developed in a different
language.

Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET applications. An
*assembly* is a logical unit of functionality from
deployment perspective. It is a versioned, self-describing binary
(DLL or EXE). An assembly, in general, consists of four elements:
manifest, type metadata, Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL),
and resources. Assembly manifest describes contents of an assembly
--- namespaces for resolving requests for types, types that are
accessible only from within an assembly, types that are exported,
and security permissions for running the assembly. Type metadata
describes information about types. MSIL is computer-independent
representation of programs written in .NET-aware languages. MSIL
is subsequently converted into computer-specific instructions
using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

An assembly is single-file or multi-file depending on how it is
produced. In *single-file assemblies*, all elements of an
assembly are contained in a single physical file. Elements of an
assembly are contained in multiple physical files in the case of a
*multi-file assembly*. An assembly can be static or
dynamic. *Static assemblies* are stored on disk in Portable
Execution (PE) file format. In contrast, *dynamic
assemblies* are run directly from memory after their generation.
You can save them after their execution. An assembly can be
private or shared. A *private assembly* is used only by the
application with which it has been deployed. In contrast,
*shared assemblies* are used by several applications. They
are installed in a machine-wide Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and
are required to have strong names. A *strong name*
guarantees name uniqueness and facilitates *side-by-side*
execution.

Managed execution process describes the steps required to take
advantage of CLR. They include choosing a .NET-aware language
compiler, developing code, compiling the code into MSIL, compiling
MSIL into native code, and executing the native code.

Namespace is a concept that is used to organize code and define a
scope for types. Using namespaces avoids type name conflicts in
your program. All namespaces in .NET that are shipped by Microsoft
begin with either System or Microsoft.

The .NET Framework provides several tools and utilities to help
programmers. They include Intermediate Language (IL) Disassembler,
Windows Class Viewer, ClassBrowser Web application, and Visual
Studio.NET Object Browser. You use IL Disassembler to examine the
contents of an assembly. Windows Class Viewer is used to browse
definitions of types in FCL. ClassBrowser Web application is an
alternative to Windows Class Viewer to browse .NET namespaces and
types in them. Visual Studio.NET Object Browser is yet another
alternative for exploring namespaces and their types.


Visual Studio.NET is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
for developing .NET applications. It features a syntax-aware text
editor which helps you to eliminate most of the syntax errors as
you type your program. Wizards are also available to help you
develop code. IDE provides several toolbars including Standard,
Text Editor, Debug, and Debug Location. You can look at your code
from different perspectives using Solution Explorer, Server
Explorer, Class View, Resource View, and Properties.

The IDE also features a GUI debugger. Features such as
breakpoints, Step Into, Step Over, Step Out, Watch and other
windows in a graphical environment makes debugging easier and more
productive.

## Exercises

1. Determine if each of the following statements is true or false:

     - MSIL is a set of machine-specific instructions.
     - Managed code benefits from features such as cross-language integration, cross-language exception
       handling, enhanced security, etc.
     - In .NET, the term type refers to only classes and structures.
     - Reference types are allocated on the heap.
     - Value types derive from System.ValueType class.
     - Operations on one value type variable can affect another value type variable.
     - Types provided in Framework Class Library are CLS-complaint.
     - An assembly is a self-describing DLL or EXE unit.  
     - A private assembly must have a strong name.
     - Static assemblies are created using the Reflection.Emit API classes.
