<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Panormic View of Computer Science</h1>
<p>Computer Science has been one of the fastest grown disciplines during the last few decades. The growth and innovation has been phenomenal. Computing power that was encased into multi- million dollar, mammoth size IBM Mainframe computers of the 1960s is made available today in laptop computers. Advent of the World-Wide Web (WWW) in 1993 has spurred even more interest in computers and indeed they have become a household name. It is quite uncommon not to find a computer on the desks of employees of organizations. Productivity software such as word processors and spreadsheets that run on these desktop computers has become a commodity item. Computers have become an integral part of our personal and societal life directly and indirectly. They are being used for tasks ranging from home security alarm systems to running airplanes and nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>As impressive as the advances in computing discipline are, there are different views on what exactly is computer science. Is it a science? Or, is it an engineering discipline? Or yet, is it an art? All of these view points seem equally valid given one’s exposure and experience of the discipline. It is a science because of its rigorous mathematical underpinnings and its core is rooted in computability theory, formal languages, and algorithmics, among others. It is an engineering discipline in that precise engineering design and micro-manufacturing processes go into the making of the computers. Those that had the fortune of building and maintaining complex, enterprise-scale applications will attest to the fact that software development is by far carried out as an art form practice rather than as an engineering practice.</p>
<p>Before we embark on our study of computer science, in light of the above observations, it is imperative that we answer the question of precisely what body of knowledge constitutes the computer science discipline. We expect the answers to this question identify the core concepts and practices in computer science. It would be an added bonus if the answers also include the types of problems that computers have been used to solve and how the solutions have been developed. Therefore, objectives for this chapter are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide a conceptual description of subjects areas of computer science that are collectively regarded as representing the core principles and practices in the discipline.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe various classes of computers and their intended use.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain types of system software and their functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain embedded software and its applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss various application software and the problems that they solve.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide an overview programming language concepts and describe programming paradigms.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce the concept of abstract machine hierarchy.</p></li>

<div id="Facets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Facets Of Computer Science</h2>
<p>There seems to be no consensus on precisely what body of knowledge constitutes the discipline of computer science. Even if such an agreement were to exist, it is subject to change due to technological innovations and the range of problems that have been solved using a computer. The Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula 2001 has identified the following areas: Discrete Structures, Programming Fundamentals, Algorithms and Complexity, Architecture and Organization, Operating Systems, Net-Centric Computing, Programming Languages, Human-Computer Interaction, Graphics and Visual Computing, Intelligent Systems, Information Engineering <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, Software Engineering, Computational Science and Numerical Methods, and Social and Professional Issues. In the following subsections, each of the subject areas is described in some detail. It should be noted that the subject area boundaries are rather fluid and tend to change with time and technological advances.</p>
<div id="discrete-structures" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Discrete Structures</h3>
<p>Discrete Structures is to Computer Science what Calculus is to all the engineering disciplines. No engineering student can expect to master the discipline without a thorough knowledge of Calculus. In a similar vein, the study of Discrete Structures is fundamental to the study of Computer Science. Discrete Structures is the study of mathematical problems concerning finite or discrete sets. It provides many different mathematical models that have direct relevance to the problems encountered in Computer Science and Operations Research. These mathematical models can be described using finite sets and their structures. In contrast with Calculus, where the phenomenon of interest is continuous — air flow around the wings of an aircraft, pressure distribution across the thickness of a water pipe — Discrete Structures focuses on modelling and analyzing the phenomenon that is intrinsically discrete in nature. Discrete Structures encompasses the study of Sets, Relations, Functions, Mathematical Logic, Combinatorics, Discrete Probability, Digital Logic and Digital Systems, and Algebraic Structures. Other topics such as Formal Languages, Algorithm Analysis and Computational Complexity, Graph Theory, and Trees are also within the realm of Discrete Structures. The latter body of knowledge is often considered as application of Discrete Structures to Computer Science.</p>
<p>The concept of a set, set operations and structures — union, intersection, difference, complement, subsets, sequences, partitions, relations between sets, functions that map elements from one set to another — are fundamental topics in Discrete Structures. Relations between elements of sets is the foundational basis for relational data model. The industry standard language for querying relational databases—SQL (Structured Query Language)— is based on set theory. The rules of logic are used in writing computer programs, in designing computer chips, and in the construction of mathematical proofs. Mathematical induction is another proof technique that is widely used in Computer Science. It can be used, among other things, to show that a program with loops performs as expected. Combinatorial techniques are used in enumerating all possible solutions to a problem and has direct application to optimizing queries in relational databases. Using a mathematical theory of probability, one can compute the likelihood of complex events occuring under the assumption that the events are governed by appropriate axioms. Discrete probability is computed by summing (instead of integrating as in the case of continuous probability) the probabilities of individual events comprising a complex event.</p>
<p>A sequence is an ordered list of objects drawn from a set. A <em>binary sequence</em> is a sequence whose elements are drawn from the set {0,1}. All data and programs are encoded as binary sequences for execution on a computer. Binary arithmetic is used to manipulate data and programs by a computer and is the basis for digital logic and digital systems. Computational complexity theory is an area of theoretical computer science concerning <em>what</em> problems can be solved by <em>any</em> computer. On the other hand, algorithms study is concerned with devising efficient and effective algorithms for solving a given problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="programming-fundamentals" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Programming Fundamentals</h3>
<p>This area of Computer Science is concerned with developing computer programs. It encompasses the study problem solving techniques; algorithm design and analysis; structures for representing data; control structures as elementary building blocks in program construction and as a means to effect flow of control in program execution; debugging and testing strategies to insure correctness of programs, abstraction mechanisms for constructing programs; and abstraction and encapsulation mechanisms for packaging programs into functional components.</p>
<p>It is also concerned with <em>programming paradigms</em> — a set of well defined and proven high-level algorithmic steps useful in naturally solving a class of problems that exhibit certain common characteristics — and the programming languages that support the paradigms. Imperative, object-oriented, event-driven, and functional are different programming paradigms. Program translation from a high-level language to a language that computers understand is also within this realm.</p>
</div>
<div id="algorithm-and-complexity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Algorithm and Complexity</h3>
<p>Solving problems has been the hallmark of human endeavor since times immemorial. Typically a problem has input. For example, if the problem is ``Find directions to drive from Dayton, OH to Detroit, MI,&quot; the inputs are Dayton, OH and Detroit, MI. A solution to this problem is precisely specified directions to drive from Dayton to Detroit. Solution is also referred to as the output. An algorithm describes the <em>process</em> of turning inputs into output. It is a precise specification of the process. The specification is in terms of a series of steps. Each step contributes to the solution. The steps should embody computation that is feasible. The algorithm should contain a finite number of steps so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. We would like the algorithm to be <em>efficient</em> — get the work done in the least amount of time possible. We would also like the algorithm to consume as minimal amount of resources as possible. If an algorithm is executed by a computer, the resources are memory and processor cycles. Finally, we want the algorithm to be <em>generic</em> — should be able to find driving directions between any two pairs of cities and not just between Dayton and Detroit. An algorithm can be executed by a human, a robot, or a computer. Algorithms and Complexity area of Computer Science is concerned with identifying what types of problems are amenable for algorithmic solutions, and devising suitable algorithms that are both effective and efficient.</p>

<div id="computer-architecture-and-organization" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Computer Architecture and Organization</h3>
<p>A computer is a complex system comprising of multiple subsystems — processor, memory, input/output devices, sensors. Each subsystem in turn can be composed of several other components. A communication mechanism is also needed to enable these subsystems to cooperatively execute tasks. Computer architecture refers to the design principles employed in selecting and configuring the various components to produce a computer with the desired functional and performance characteristics. An architecture is <em>open</em> if its design principles are based on a framework that is not rigid and conforms to industry standards. Open architectures enable building computers by mixing and matching off-the-shelf components from different vendors. A <em>closed architecture</em> system is one that is based on a proprietary design and cannot easily connect to other vendor components or systems.</p>
<p>Differences in the architecture, functional capabilities and performance characteristics of the subsystems entail in classes of computers — tablet computers, laptops, desktops, workstations, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers. Each class is intended for solving a set of problems or for use by a segment of the computer user population. Computers, in general, have the following components: Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and a bus to interconnect these components (See Figure (fig:LANDetail).</p>
<p>This area is also concerned with the programmability aspects of the computer at the machine level. <em>Firmware</em> is a collection of programs that control the components within a subsystem. Firmware is used to control and coordinate the processor components to effect the execution of programs written in the machine language. Firmware programs are permanently stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) since they don’t change over time.</p>
<div id="central-processing-unit-cpu" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4.1</span> Central Processing unit (CPU)</h4>
<p>CPU is composed of Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), and Control Unit (CU). As the name implies, ALU performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), moving data from one location (register) to another, and logical operations such as <em>AND</em>, <em>OR</em>, and <em>NOT</em> on binary strings. ALU can also perform relational operations (<span class="math inline">\(=, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, \leq, &lt;, \geq\)</span>) on numbers and strings. A CPU is designed to execute a pre-defined repertoire of machine instructions, referred to as its <em>instruction set</em>. A machine language program is a sequence of machine instructions assembled to solve a problem. CPU is capable of understanding and executing its machine language programs.</p>
<p>Advances in microelectronics have led to creation of the entire CPU on one or a small number of integrated circuits; computers with such CPUs are known as <em>microprocessors</em>. Computational speed of a CPU is designated in terms of <em>clock rate</em> or <em>cycles per unit time</em>. Some machine instructions are executed in one CPU cycle time, while other may require multiple CPU cycles. The clock rate of a computer is normally determined by the frequency of a crystal. The original IBM personal computer had a clock rate of 4.77 MHz (close to five million cycles/second). Some recent Intel’s Pentium chips run at 2.4 GHz (close to 2.5 billion cycles/second). The clock rate of a computer is only useful for providing comparisons between computer chips in the same processor family. Clock rate should not be used when comparing different computers since the amount of work different computer chips can do in one cycle varies. In addition to clock rate, there are many other factors to consider when comparing different computers.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4.2</span> Memory</h4>
<p>Memory is used to store computer programs and as a scratch pad for storing the intermediate results of a computation. Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of memory, which is fast and expensive relative to other types. The term <em>random access</em> means that access to any piece of information in RAM takes the same amount of time. RAM is volatile — when the power is off the data disappears. RAM is referred to as <em>primary memory</em> or <em>primary storage device</em>. Other types of memory medium or devices include <em>registers</em>, <em>cache</em>, <em>magnetic disks</em>, <em>magnetic tapes</em>, <em>optical disks</em>, and <em>CD-ROM</em> (see Figure .</p>
</div>
<div id="inputoutput-io-devices" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4.3</span> Input/Output (I/o) Devices</h4>
<p>I/O devices are used to bring data into the computer and move the data out of the computer. Common I/O devices include the ubiquitous keyboard, monitor (or computer screen), mouse, (hard or magnetic) disk drive, tape drive, CD-ROM (Compact Disk - Read Only Memory), CD-RW (Compact Disk - Read Write), scanner, and printer. Others include Network Interface Card (NIC), optical disks, video and audio capture devices, and sensors of various kinds. Unlike RAM, data stored in magnetic disks and CD-ROM is non-volatile. Information can be erased and rewritten to magnetic disk over and over. Such I/O devices are known as <em>read-write</em>. CD-ROM, on the other hand, allows writing information only once but it can be read any number times. Such devices are referred to as WORM (Write Once Read Many). CD-RW is like a magnetic disk — data can be erased and rewritten. However, CD-RW is smaller in storage capacity and takes longer to access the data.</p>
<p>Since access to data on disks takes relatively longer time compared to RAM memory, they are referred to as <em>secondary storage devices</em>. Optical disk is another type of storage device for storing large amounts of data. Since optical disk and tape device access times are even greater than that of magnetic disks, they are referred to as <em>tertiary storage devices</em>. Because large amounts of information can be stored on disks and CD-ROM, they are also known as <em>mass storage devices</em>. It should be noted that magnetic disks, optical disks, and CD-ROMs are random access devices, whereas tape drive is a <em>sequential-access</em> device. Information can be read from a sequential-access device in the sequential order — to read data item <span class="math inline">\(n,\)</span> the first <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> data items need to be skipped over. The distinction between random-access and sequential-access devices is akin to that between an audio CD and audio tape.</p>
</div>
<div id="bus" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4.4</span> Bus</h4>
<p>Bus is an integral part of any computer and is used to transmit data, address, and control information among the components. There are busses within the CPU. Buses are also needed to connect the CPU to external memory and peripheral devices. Depending on the type of data they transmit, they are referred to as <em>data</em> <em>bus</em>, <em>address bus</em>, and <em>control bus</em> (see Figures <a href="#fig:Buses1"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#fig:Buses2"><strong>??</strong></a>. Despite their names, they are really a single bus since any one is useless without the others. Width of a bus is its structural characteristic and designates number of parallel connectors. The wider the bus, the more information it can transmit. Both the bus width and its clock rate determine its <em>data rate</em> — the number of bytes it can transmit per second. Most current microprocessors have 32-bit busses with a clock rate of 100 or 133 megahertz (MHz). The bus clock is typically slower than the CPU clock. Various bus designs have been used in personal computers, including ISA, EISA, Micro Channel, VL-bus and PCI.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Operating Systems</h3>
<p>An Operating System is a program that interfaces between the user and the computer, application programs and the computer. It is the most important program and is entrusted with great many responsibilities. Every general-purpose computer comes with an operating system. Windows XP and UNIX <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> are two operating systems that are widely used.</p>
<div id="characteristics" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5.1</span> Characteristics</h4>
<p>Operating systems are characterized by attributes such as <em>multi-user</em>, <em>multi-processing</em>, <em>multi-tasking</em>, and <em>multi-threading</em>. A multi-user operating system permits several users to use the computer concurrently and each user is allowed to execute several programs concurrently. A multiprocessing operating system enables running a program using multiple processor on the same computer. Multitasking endows an operating system with the capability to run multiple programs concurrently. Multitasking capability is a prerequisite for multi-user operating systems. Multithreading characteristic allows running different parts of a single program to run concurrently, possibly on different processors. A real-time operating system is one that has a predictive behavior — responds within a specified interval of time. They are are used in embedded systems for managing, for example, nuclear power plants.</p>
</div>
<div id="functions" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5.2</span> Functions</h4>
<p>An operating system performs multiple functions in different roles — security manager, process manager, command interpreter, resource manager, scheduler, file system manager, among others. As a security manager, it is responsible for insuring that only authorized users can access the system and execute only those functions that they are entitled to. A program in action is called a process. A program needs resources such as the processor and memory to become a process. As a process manager, the operating system is responsible for assigning the required resources to the processes, starting and terminating them, insuring that processes execute without interfering with each other and share common resources in a mutually exclusive manner when needed. Users and programs interact with the operating system through a set of commands and <em>system calls</em>. For example, commands exist for copying, renaming, and deleting a file. The part of the operating system that intercepts and processes these commands is called a <em>command processor</em>, <em>command line interpretor</em>, or <em>shell</em>.</p>
<p>IN resource manager’s role, it a responsible for managing the system resources (processors, memory) and the peripheral devices (e.g., disk systems, printers, keyboard, mouse) and providing access to them for users and programs via application programming interfaces. The operating system also takes on the responsibility of scheduling requests for processors, disks, and printers. As a file system manager, it is responsible for allocating space for user and application files, organizing and keeping track of files. Most of the operating systems feature a hierarchical file system in which files are grouped into directories and directories form an inverted tree structure. Another important function of an operating system is to provide mechanisms for processes to communicate with each other — InterProcess Communication (IPC). Techniques such as <em>shared memory</em> and <em>messaging</em> are used for IPC.</p>
<p>An operating system usually provides a set of utility programs. These utilities vary from simple text editor, to text formatters, to compilers and sophisticated program debugging tools. Especially the UNIX operating system comes with a powerful set of utility programs. The latter can be strung together using a scripting language to accomplish significant tasks without writing any programs at all.</p>

<div id="net-centric-computing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Net-Centric Computing</h3>
<p>No matter how powerful a computer is, by itself its use is rather limited. The real power of computing comes into play when two or more computers can communicate and collaboratively solve complex problems. A group of computers that are connected via a communication mechanism is referred to as a <em>computer</em> <em>network</em>. Each computer in a network is called a <em>node</em>. There are different types of networks including local area networks (LANs), wide-area networks (WANs), campus-area networks (CANs), metropolitan-area networks (MANs), and home-area networks (HANs).</p>
<div id="lans" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6.1</span> LANs</h4>
<p>omputers on a LAN are geographically close together, more often reside in the same building. Each node on a LAN has its own CPU with which it executes programs. A node can also access other nodes on the LAN. This enables sharing expensive resources such as plotters and color printers among the LAN users. Similarly, files can also be shared. LAN users can communicate with each other via e-mails and instant messengers. There are many different types of LANs. Best known among them are <em>Ethernets</em> for desktop computers and workstations, and <em>AppleTalk</em> for Macintosh computers.</p>
<p>LANs are differentiated based on topology, protocols, architecture, and media. <em>Topology</em> refers to geometric arrangement of nodes in the network. There are different topologies — ring, bus, star, point-to-point. Bus topology LAN is shown in Figure <a href="Pano.html#fig:LANDetail">1.1</a>. <em>Protocols</em> are the rules for communication between the nodes including the type of error checking to be used, data compression method, how the sending device will indicate that it has finished sending a message, and how the receiving device will indicate that it has received the message. LAN <em>architecture</em> refers to how the nodes collaborate in accomplishing a task: peer-to-peer and client-server are two such architectures. <em>Media</em> refers to either physical (e.g., twisted-pair wire) or non-physical (e.g., radio waves for wireless networks) medium that is used to connect the nodes. Other physical media choices include coaxial and fiber optic cables.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>One LAN can be connected to another LAN over any distance using a suitable media. A system of LANs connected in this way is referred to as a WAN. Internet is a best example of a WAN in existence. Thus, Internet is a mammoth network of networks and connects millions of computers globally. Any computer connected to the Internet can communicate and exchange data with any other computer on the Internet subject to security constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="cans-mans-and-hans" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6.2</span> CANs, MANs, and HANs</h4>
<p>Nodes in a CAN are limited to a geographic area, such as a military base, an industrial area, or a campus. MANs are networks designed for a city or town. HANs refers to a network contained within a user’s home that connects home computers, DVD players, home security systems, and ``smart&quot; appliances. Like any other engineering task, network design involves careful tradeoff between various facets — topology, protocols, architecture, and media. For example, in case of protocols, some are simpler than others, some are faster, while other are more reliable.</p>
</div>
<div id="application-architectures" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6.3</span> Application Architectures</h4>
<p>A computer network unfolds several distributed architectures for developing applications — Client-server, Multi-tier, Web-based, Services-based. <em>Client-server</em> is an application architecture where a specific computer is designated as the server which provides a specialized service centrally. Print servers, file servers, and database servers are examples of this category. Clients are other programs or computers which request services of the server. Typically the server and the clients are connected using a LAN and the computers themselves can be of disparate types. Client-server architecture is an example of <em>two-tier</em> (application) <em>architecture</em>. The server constitute one tier and the clients constitute the other tier.<em>Multi-tier</em> <em>architecture</em> is a generalization of two-tier client-server architecture. A node can act as a server under one context and as a client in another context. In a service provider role the node acts as a server, and in service requestor role it acts as the client. The nodes in a multi-tier architecture are typically confined to a LAN or WAN.</p>
<p>Web-based architecture takes the multi-tier architecture to the next level by removing the requirement that the nodes be confined to a LAN or WAN. Any node on the World-Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) can be a service provider or service requester, or both. It should be noted that Internet and WWW are not synonymous. Web is a way of accessing documents on the Internet using HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol). Such documents are formatted using a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The Web also enables accessing other types of documents including animations, audio and video clips, and graphics. Not all the Internet servers participate in the WWW. Internet is also used for transmitting e-mail using <em>SMTP</em> (Simple Mail Transport Protocol), Usenet news groups, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and instant messaging. Every computer that communicates over the Internet is assigned an <em>IP address</em>. This address uniquely identifies the computer and distinguishes it from other computers on the Internet. An IP address is 32 bits in length.</p>
<p>Web servers are specialized computers that process requests for information sent over the Web using the HTTP protocol. Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), and Free Software Foundation’s Apache are well-known Web servers. Web browsers are programs that are used to navigate the Web and to render the HTML documents. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are two popular Web browsers.</p>
</div>
<div id="security" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6.4</span> Security</h4>
<p>Security is one of the greatest challenges in this area and is critical to <em>electronic commerce</em> (e-commerce) applications. It is of two fold. The first one is authenticating the identity and determining the entitlements of the requester. The second one is to insure that the data is transmitted in an encrypted form and unauthorized users don’t siphon off the data using sniffers. Effective tools and techniques for network management — monitoring the network for node failures, network congestion, sabotage, and attacks — are equally important. <em>SNMP</em> (Simple Network Monitoring Protocol) is a protocol for this purpose.</p>
<p>Recent advances in multimedia technologies coupled with Web-based architecture contributed to the emergence of new applications for distance learning, distributed collaborative problem solving, and net meetings.</p>
</div>
<div id="web-services" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6.5</span> Web Services</h4>
<p>The most recent distributed computing architecture aims at programming the Web. Under this scenario, a software application is ``weaved&quot; by composing services from different servers on the Web. For instance, a word processor application is composed by making use of three service providers — one provides a text editor, the other provides a formatting engine, and yet another provides a spell checker. Industry converging on standards like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, Integration), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is helping to propel services-based distributed computing towards a reality.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.7</span> Programming Languages</h3>
<p>This realm of Computer Science is concerned with designing programming languages for encoding algorithmic solutions so that the latter can be executed by a computer. Solving a problem using a computer is a two step process. First, a suitable algorithm need to be devised. Second, the algorithm is expressed in a language that the computer understands. Such languages are called programming languages. Natural languages — for example, English — are too complex for a computer to comprehend. Furthermore, algorithm steps expressed using a natural language may lack precision and thus entail ambiguity. A programming language, on the other hand, has a unique set of keywords that it understands, a well-defined syntax and semantics, and control structures. Syntax refers to the grammatical rules of the language governing the construction and organization of program statements. Semantics refers to the meaning of various statements in the language from the computation point of view. Control structures direct the order of execution of statements in a program.</p>
<p>Languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, C++, Java, and C# are referred to as <em>high-level programming languages</em>. Their syntax and programming constructs available for organizing program instructions are at a higher level of abstraction. Programs can also be written using a machine language. Such programs are amenable for direct execution on the computer. However, machine languages feature a lower level of abstraction and a machine language program is simply a string composed of binary digits 0 and 1. Programs written in high-level languages are translated into machine language by a program called the <em>compiler</em>. Languages that fall between machine languages and high-level languages are called <em>assembly languages</em>. Though assembly languages are similar to machine languages, they are relatively easier to program since they allow substituting symbolic names for binary numbers. An <em>assembler</em> is a program which translates assembly language programs into machine language. Even today some programs are developed in assembly language since the latter offers direct access to a computer’s memory structures and results in efficient programs in terms of execution speed.</p>
<p>There is a class of languages above the high-level languages called the <em>fourth-generation languages</em>. They are typically intended for use by non-programmers. Users declaratively specify <em>what</em> needs to be accomplished as opposed to <em>how</em> it can be accomplished.</p>
<p>There exists a multitude of programming languages. Which language is appropriate for a given task depends on various factors. Every language has its strengths and weaknesses and is designed for use in solving a specific class of problems.Section <a href="Pano.html#PLOverview">1.6</a></p>

<div id="human-computer-interaction" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.8</span> Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
<p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a discipline concerned with the study, design, construction, and implementation of human-centric interactive computer systems. HCI’s scope is more than just designing and implementing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and menus that are intuitive and easy to use. It is a very broad discipline and draws upon ideas and advances in sociology and anthropology, psychology, linguistics, and ergonomics. Sociology and anthropology address the issues that arise out of interactions between work and organization, and technology. It is also concerned with the way human systems and technological systems adapt to each other. Psychology comes into play to make the user interaction more intuitive by modelling human cognitive processes and the behavior of the users. Linguistics role is in the development of natural and machine languages and the interplay between the two. Ergonomics is the study of physical design of workspace, lighting, chair, keyboard, physical screens or monitors, and related peripheral devices, and the manner in which people work and interact in such a space or environment. Ergonomic design is vital to insure the safety of computer users from problems such as repetitive stress syndrome.</p>
<p>Early computer systems provided a simple character-based interfaces using a keyboard. Then GUIs and menus became popular user interfaces and mouse was the preferred device to navigate these interfaces. Graphics and image processing systems employed a device known as <em>graphics tablet</em> to effect direct interaction with a graphic or image, whereas game systems employed <em>joy stick</em> as the device for interacting with the game programs. Point of Sale (POS) systems, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Kiosks, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) employ a combination a simplified keyboard, pen or stylus, and touch panels as means for providing the user interfaces.</p>
<p>The advent of the Web and advances in multimedia technology brought additional challenges to the HCI. Interfaces for Web applications should be designed as interfaces for the masses — intuitive and easy to use, require little or no training, minimize the likelihood for making mistakes, recover gracefully from user interaction mistakes. Interacting with multimedia data — text, images, graphics, audio, video, animation — demands innovative interfaces that are intrinsically suited to the type of media. For example, images can be queried based on color, texture, type of objects contained in the image, object’s shape, spatial layout of the objects, and a combination of these. To query images based on some of these characteristics, an user interface that allows the user to sketch a query — query by example — maybe a logical choice. As computers become more entrenched in our society, HCI assumes even a greater role in looking for ways and means to making the interaction with the computer systems more intuitive, efficient, and safe.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9</span> Graphics and Visual Computing</h3>
<p>This facet of Computer Science deals with generation, capture, processing, manipulation, display, and printing of visual information. There are three subareas: Computer Graphics, Images and Video, and Visualization. There are two major aspects to the study of these subareas — physical devices that are used for generating, capturing, and displaying/printing of visual information, and the software programs that are used to process and manipulate the visual information for various purposes.</p>
<div id="computer-graphics" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9.1</span> Computer Graphics</h4>
<p>Computer Graphics is concerned with generating synthetic images and rendering them to look realistic. There are four broad categories of graphics software: Paint programs, Presentation graphics, Illustration graphics, and Design graphics. Paint programs are low-end graphics programs that are used to create freehand drawings. The drawings are stored in a raster-based format such as bitmap and can easily be edited. Microsoft Paint is an example of this category. Presentation graphics are programs that are used to create graphics that are typically used in slide shows and reports — bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, scatter plots. The data for these graphics can be imported from spreadsheet applications such Lotus 123 or Microsoft Excel. Spreadsheet programs themselves have capabilities for producing most commonly used charts and graphs. Illustration graphics software sports more advanced features that are often required in engineering drawing and graphic arts. Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw are well-known programs in this category. Design graphics software is the most advanced and sophisticated among the graphics programs. It is primarily used by engineers for designing automobiles, aircraft, ships, computer chips, and various sorts of machine parts. Design graphics software is known as CAD (Computer Aided Design) software.</p>
</div>
<div id="images-and-video" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9.2</span> Images and Video</h4>
<p>In contrast with the computer graphics, images and video subarea focuses on capturing images of an existing artifact and processing them for various purposes. Processing is done for improving the visual appearance of an image (e.g., photo touch up using programs such as Adobe Photoshop), restoring a degraded image to its original form (typical of remotely sensed satellite imagery),and extracting features and measuring them (as done in medical imaging to aid in disease diagnosis).</p>
</div>
<div id="visualization" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9.3</span> Visualization</h4>
<p>Visualization involves the study of techniques for revealing meaning hidden in the data. It offers techniques for exploring, analyzing, and communicating information about the data. Scientific visualization refers to communication of knowledge via visualization techniques. Animation is related to visualization, and involves showing several graphics or images in quick succession to simulate motion. Animation techniques are widely used in applications such as flight simulators, arcade games, and movies.</p>
</div>
<div id="common-issues" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.9.4</span> Common Issues</h4>
<p>The following issues transcend all the three subareas. Graphics and image data tends to be voluminous and processing is memory- and processor-intensive. Typically images and graphics are transmitted in compressed format for efficiency reasons. Applications that support graphics and images require powerful workstations or specially designed graphics workstations. The pervasiveness of graphics and images has resulted in large graphics and image repositories. This has necessitated the need for powerful yet flexible retrieval techniques to identify and retrieve relevant images from the repositories.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="intelligent-systems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.10</span> Intelligent Systems</h3>
<p>This branch of Computer Science is concerned with various aspects of developing computer systems that exhibit human-like intelligent behavior. Cognitive tasks performed by humans are of two kinds — commonsense tasks and expert tasks. <em>Commonsense tasks</em> are the ones such as conversing in a natural language, and walking. <em>Expert tasks</em>, on the other hand, require a great deal of domain expertise. Writing a technical paper, diagnosing diseases, and performing surgery are examples of expert tasks.</p>
<p>Initial investigations in this area were on game playing, natural language translation and understanding. Impressive advances were made recently in game playing. A chess program running on an IBM supercomputer defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a match in 1997. Natural language processing offers the greatest potential rewards especially in the area of human-computer interaction. However, the problem remains elusive to date.</p>
<p>Machine learning, visual perception and image understanding, robotics, and knowledge-based expert systems also subsequently came under the realm of intelligent systems. <em>Machine</em> <em>learning</em> aims at designing strategies and techniques for computer programs to learn from examples and experiences. Neural Networks are learning systems that simulate human intelligence by attempting to reproduce the types of physical connections that occur in biological brains. They made significant inroads in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition, pattern recognition and classification.<em>Visual perception and image</em> <em>understanding</em> deals with endowing computer systems (e.g., robots) with human-like vision capabilities so that they can navigate the physical space which is possibly hazardous for humans — nuclear power plants, areas infested with biological weapons — understand the scene, and perform useful actions. The present state of the art in robotics is limited to using them in a highly controlled environments for repetitive tasks — configuring and packaging products in factory assembly lines. <em>Knowledge-based systems</em> or knowledge-based expert systems is an umbrella term to refer to a class of programs which configure and perform according to the domain knowledge made available to them.</p>
<div id="knowledge-representation-and-inference" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.10.1</span> Knowledge Representation and Inference</h4>
<p>Central to the domain of intelligent systems are the concepts of knowledge representation and inference. Domain knowledge is one of the prerequisites for intelligent behavior. Therefore, a principal task in building intelligent systems is encoding or representing the domain knowledge into suitable data structures. Inference rules encode the reasoning methods — deriving new knowledge from the existing knowledge — associated with the knowledge representation schemes. If representational details are omitted, there are three main approaches for knowledge representation: slot-and-filler structures, logical formulas, and production rules. Under <em>slot-and-filler structures</em> method, the domain of discourse has certain domain objects. Slots are attributes which are used to describe the properties of domain objects. Fillers are the values assigned to these attributes for a specific instance of the domain object. The domain objects are cast in a hierarchical tree-like structure to capture the relationships among the objects. Inference is effected by matching the values that represent the task context with relevant part of the tree structure and traversing the tree up and down based on the domain object relationships.</p>
<p>In the second approach, <em>logical formulas</em> are used to describe the domain objects and to capture the relationships among them. The formal power of logical theorem proving is used to infer new knowledge. However, this may result in combinatorial explosion — number of choices to choose from at each step of a solution is large and all choices need to be systematically explored to arrive at a solution — renders the method impractical. In the last approach, domain knowledge is represented as production rules. <em>Production rules</em> are of the form: <em>IF</em> condition(s) <em>THEN</em> action(s). For example, in the domain of disease diagnostics, conditions represent various symptoms and the action part specifies what the disease might be. The action part may include a weight (in the range 0 to 1), known as <em>certainty</em> <em>factor</em>, to indicate the degree of faith in the recommended action.</p>
</div>
<div id="state-space-search" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.10.2</span> State Space Search</h4>
<p>A prerequisite for solving problems is that they must be precisely defined. <em>State space search paradigm</em> is a powerful, general-purpose framework for rigorously defining the problems. Problem definition, under this framework, encompasses five steps: defining state space, the initial state(s), the final or goal state(s), rules that govern transitions between the states, and heuristic knowledge such as preferred or recommended transitions between the states under different contexts. Then, a solution to the problem is finding a path through the state space beginning at an initial state and ending at an end state. As an example, for board games such as chess, state space is the chess board configuration. Initial state is how the pieces (i.e., soldiers, knights, pawn, queen, king) of the two players are positioned on the board at the beginning of the game. Goal state(s) are the positions in which opponent’s king has been captured. Rules are the legal moves of the chess game, and the heuristic knowledge are the functions that evaluate board positions to assess their chance that they will lead to a win, standard opening moves, etc.</p>
<p>Though there exists several programming languages for constructing intelligent systems, LISP and Prolog are the well-known ones.</p>

<div id="IE" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.11</span> Information Engineering</h3>
<p>Information Engineering addresses issues related to structuring, storing, and retrieval of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. It is also concerned with transforming data into information. Volume of data considered here can be in the order of terabytes (A terabyte is <span class="math inline">\(2^{40} = 1,099,511,627,776\)</span> bytes.).<em>Structured information</em> has well-defined structure and semantics. For example, a collection of employee records is a piece of structured information. An employee record may consist of first name, last name, address, date of birth, title, and salary. Collection of such records can be stored in a file or a database table and retrieved based on various criteria such as: names of employees whose salary exceeds $50,000. It is assumed that the attributes first name, last name, address, date of birth, title, and salary capture all the information of interest about an employee. Using data modelling techniques, one can determine information entities or elements, their attributes, constraints on the entities, relationships between the entities to meet the information needs of an organization. The resulting artifact is referred to as a <em>data model</em>. In other words, data model is an abstraction for describing the information elements, their semantics and constraints, and the relationships among the elements.</p>
<div id="structured-information" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.11.1</span> Structured Information</h4>
<p>Initially file systems were used for managing the structured information. File system have several shortcomings. Database Management Systems (DBMS) were introduced to remedy these shortcomings and to deal with massive amounts of data. DBMS provides a secure, shared, and concurrent access to the data, eliminates data redundancy (i.e., avoids storing multiple copies of the same data) and the concomitant inconsistency problem, enforces integrity constraints on the data (e.g., an employee’s salary can never be a negative number), provides transactional capability (ability to treat several database operations as one logical operation at the application level), and automatically recovers from software and hardware failures. An overarching design objective for a DBMS is to provide <em>data independence</em> –— the ability to change the database structures without changing the applications that use the database.</p>
</div>
<div id="unstructured-information" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.11.2</span> Unstructured Information</h4>
<p>Unstructured information, on the other hand, has no well-defined structure and semantics. For example, consider a collection of technical research papers. How do we model the information content of a paper? What portion of the document do we consider for the modelling task? Do we consider only the title, authors, title and abstract, or the entire text of the paper? A set of keywords? Or, a set of keywords with weights that are proportional to their relative significance in reflecting the information content of the paper? How are user queries specified? What matching strategies are used in identifying relevant documents to the user query? Solutions to these issues become even more difficult if we extend the unstructured information to encompass multimedia data—graphics, images, animation, audio and video. Information Retrieval systems are used for managing textual document collections. Multimedia data is managed using Multimedia Retrieval Systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="semi-structured-information" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.11.3</span> Semi-Structured Information</h4>
<p>In between the structured and unstructured information lies <em>semi-structured information</em>. Examples of this kind include markup documents such as HTML and XML. The structure and semantics of semi-structured documents is not as rigid and precise as in the case of structured information. Semi-structured information is managed within the framework of relational, object-relational, or object-oriented database management systems with suitable extensions.</p>
<p>One aspect of Information Engineering that transcends both semi-structured and unstructured information is how it is presented or displayed, better known as <em>multimedia</em> <em>presentation</em>. The goal of Hypertext and Hypermedia Systems is to address this problem. These systems have important practical uses in searching on-line documentation, digital libraries, and computer-based training (CBT).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="SEIntro" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12</span> Software Engineering</h3>
<p>Software Engineering (SE) is concerned with developing reliable and safe software-intensive systems. It addresses not only the technical aspects of building software systems, but also project management issues, such as organizing and directing programming teams, forecasting resources, scheduling, and budgeting. Life cycle of a software project encompasses the following steps: requirements gathering and analysis, requirements specification, conceptual and detailed design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Software Engineering employs rigorous and systematic engineering approaches to developing software systems that meet the specified functional and non-functional (e.g., performance, availability, reliability) requirements. It provides processes and methodologies, and measurement techniques to insure quality and to track progress.</p>
<div id="requirements" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.1</span> Requirements</h4>
<p>As simple as it may seem, gathering requirements is one of the difficult task. It is hard even for those who are intimately familiar with the problem domain to articulate the requirements in a level of detail to generate a requirements specification document <em>Use cases</em> and <em>use case stories</em> are two techniques that have come into existence recently to help with the requirements elicitation task. <em>Rapid prototyping</em> is another technique for eliciting requirements. This requires quickly building a (throw-away) prototype and using it as a means to probe the system users to discover the requirements. <em>Joint</em> <em>Application Development</em> (JAD) is a methodology that requires the involvement of both the system users and system developers in defining the system requirements.</p>
<p>If the proposed system is a replacement for an existing (legacy) system, it is important to carefully glean the requirements realized in the existing system. This is a good starting point to which additional requirements can be added to. Several systems have failed due to what is known as <em>feature regression</em> — the new system upon completion didn’t even have those features of the existing system, let alone having new features. There is an interesting corollary to this. Several software projects have failed due to the inability in precisely defining the scope and functionality of the system. This is referred to as <em>scope</em> and <em>feature creep</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="design" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.2</span> Design</h4>
<p>Software design is the process of precisely specifying how the system is going to be built, given the requirements specifications. There are several software design methodologies including Structured Analysis and Design, Object-oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), and Component-based Design. Software design has several goals including reuse, maintainability, and reliability. Unified Modeling Language (UML) — a set of formal and informal notations — is an industry standard language for documenting various artifacts of software design. Based on years of collective software engineering practice across various problem domains, a set of best practices have been captured and documented — <em>design patterns</em>. A design pattern is simply a problem-solution pair. It describes the characteristics of a generic problem and demonstrates a proven solution. The idea is that if the problem at hand is similar to the problem that a design pattern solves, then simply use the solution recommended by the design pattern rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>
</div>
<div id="construction" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.3</span> Construction</h4>
<p>Construction is converting the design into code. It may also require reusing code developed for another project or code purchased in the form of code libraries or class libraries. Code libraries feature an API (Application Programming Interface). API specifies the syntax and semantics for using the functionality manifested in the code library in the form of library calls. A code library typically will have hundreds of functions and procedures and there is an API associated with each function and procedure. Class libraries feature functionality at a class level. A class has both structure and behavior. Behavior of a class is made available via methods of the class. Making use of functionality of a class involves either invoking the methods of the class or developing a new class based on the classes in the class library.</p>
</div>
<div id="validation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.4</span> Validation</h4>
<p>Testing is one aspect of software validation. The goal of testing is to uncover any errors or bugs in the software before it is put into production. There are two approaches to testing: black-box and white-box. Under the <em>black-box</em> approach, testing is carried out without knowing how a piece of software has been implemented. Focus is on whether or not the software is producing the expected results for a given set of input values. In contrast, <em>white-box</em> testing looks into the implementation details of how a piece of code has been implemented.</p>
<p>There are several types of testing: unit, integration, system, user acceptance, and regression. Unit testing focuses on a small piece of code, usually a procedure, function, or a class. <em>Unit testing</em> is the only test type done by the developer of the code. All other test types are typically carried out by a separate Quality Assurance (QA) team. In <em>integration</em> <em>testing</em>, several unit-tested pieces of software is tested together to validate their collective behavior.<em>System testing</em> is done in an environment which is quite similar or identical to the environment in which the system will go into production. The intent here is to validate the interaction of the system under development with other subsystems, and to insure compatibility with the infrastructure and other environmental factors of the production environment.</p>
<p>Other validation techniques include design reviews, and code inspections. There are formal methods to validate software systems. However, they are not practical even for small, realistic systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="deployment" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.5</span> Deployment</h4>
<p>Activities in the deployment phase include installing and configuring the system in the production environment, insuring that the production environment features the required infrastructure and meets other environmental requirements, migrating the data from existing or legacy system into the new system, and providing training to the people who will be managing and using the new system.</p>
</div>
<div id="maintenance" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.6</span> Maintenance</h4>
<p>Maintenance phase activities comprise fixing bugs (i.e., software errors) as discovered by the users, and making patch releases to replace a portion of the code that has been changed to fix the bugs. Maintenance may also include software evolution —– feature enhancements to the system as requested by the users.</p>
</div>
<div id="availability-and-reliability" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.7</span> Availability and Reliability</h4>
<p>Availability is the probability that the system is available for users at any given time. It is concerned with making a software system fail-safe. This involves identifying all single points of failure in the system and providing <em>redundancy</em> and <em>fault-tolerance</em> based on a chosen software availability model. <em>Reliability</em>, on the other hand, is the probability that the system is producing the correct results. Like most other engineering problems, there is a trade-off between the degree of availability and reliability desired and the costs in providing them.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-management" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.8</span> Project Management</h4>
<p>Not all software project management issues are unique to software projects. In fact, most of the issues apply equally to other types of projects such a construction of a high-rise building. Activities include putting the project team in place, defining their roles and reporting responsibilities, determining training needs, and documenting protocols for team communication. A detailed <em>project plan</em> showing task level breakdown of the project activities, resource assignment, task duration, and task dependencies needs to be produced as well. This is a living document in that it should always be current and valid. Proper tools are needed for tracking project progress, software versioning and configuration management, software validation, and issues and bugs tracking. Assessing and managing risk as well as fall-back options are also necessary tasks in the project management.</p>
</div>
<div id="reuse" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.12.9</span> Reuse</h4>
<p>Writing code from scratch is not the only way to develop software systems. Reusable pieces of code in the form of code libraries and class libraries has been used to reduce the development cycle time. However, this type of reusability is at the code level. What is needed is the reusability at a functional level. In case of the banking domain, application-level functionality is such as creating an account, transferring funds from one account to another, producing a period-end statement, and inquiring account balance. True reusability is achieved when such application-level functionality is packaged into components which can run on any computer, and are accessible from any other computer over the network. This is the domain of <em>component-based software</em>. Under this scenario, it possible to develop an application quickly by assembling and configuring the relevant software components. <em>Web Services</em> is an industry initiative in this direction. However, it should be recognized that there are inherent risks in this approach.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="computational-science-and-numerical-methods" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.13</span> Computational Science and Numerical Methods</h3>
<p>This is an area that encompasses topics in numerical analysis, operations research, modelling and simulation, and high-performance computing. They are of greater interest to engineers and physicists. Applications include simulations, scientific visualization, economic forecasting, weather forecasting, structural analysis using finite element methods, fluid dynamics, molecular modelling, computational biology, bioinformatics, and geological modelling to name a few. They are characterized by massive computations and the required computing power is only available in a specially designed high-performance computers.</p>
<p>Numerical analysis is concerned with floating-point arithmetic, error control, stability, convergence of series, numerical integration and differentiation, differential equations, linear algebra, iterative solutions for finding roots of polynomials, and curve fitting. Operations research investigates issues in linear programming, probabilistic modelling, network analysis and routing, prediction and estimation, and dynamic programming.</p>
<p>Modelling and simulation has many practical applications. It is used to study system behavior without actually constructing the system. Constructing a real system may be cost prohibitive or unsafe (e.g., creating and studying the effects of a biological warfare). Random number generation conforming to different probability distributions, discrete-event and continuous simulation, and queuing theory models are of interest.</p>
<p>High-performance computing is an area that addresses harnessing the computing power necessary to solve computationally intensive problems by various architectural means such as pipelining, parallelism in processors and input/output devices, and associative memory access. Of late, there has been intense interest in <em>grid computing</em> — efficiently harnessing the collective computational power of the various computers connected via a network.</p>
</div>
<div id="SocProfIssues" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.14</span> Social and Professional Issues</h3>
<p>In addition to the mastery of technical aspects of the discipline, it is equally important to understand the societal and professional implications of the discipline. Knowing the history of computing puts the current state of the field in the right perspective besides an appreciation for the pioneering work of great many scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. It would also be an interesting exercise to imagine how our modern society would have been without computers. Certain people would argue that all these advances are not necessarily contributed to improving the quality of life in general. Think about the societal implication of the Web. It made possible to share and access reference and other information meant for public dissemination instantly for global audience around the clock. It ushered in a short lived era of ``new&quot; economy, and paved the way for electronic commerce as a new channel for sales and marketing. On the flip side, imagine what it would be like if all the businesses were successful electronic businesses (e-businesses). There are no bookstores to go to, and no neighborhood grocery stores to shop in.</p>
<p>As a responsible professional, one should ask questions during the design stage of a software system its implications to the human quality of life, or its impact to a particular segment of the society. One needs to be cognizant about the potential risks and liabilities of computer-based systems. No amount of testing can give one an absolute guarantee that a software system is bug-free and safe. One should recognize that there is inherent danger in reusing a piece of software — be it an in-house class library or a purchased component.</p>
<p>One should also understand professional code of conduct at work place. What constitutes acceptable use of computers for personal work at office during the working hours and outside the working hours? Does your employer guarantee privacy of your e-mail? Or, is it considered public information within the company? What kind of actions are construed to be discriminatory and harassing at work place?</p>
<p>Next there is the issue of intellectual property: copyrights, software patents, and trade secrets. They need to be honored and protected. Consider software piracy, for example. If there are no laws to protect software companies from piracy, think about what it means to the company and you as an employee of the company. One needs to be cognizant of the rights of the software vendor, hardware vendor, and users as well as the rights and liabilities associated with software licensing.</p>
<p>Privacy and civil liberties is another issue. A malicious attack on massive databases such as the ones maintained by the Internal Revenue Service poses a serious threat to the privacy of millions of tax payers. Though civil liberties entitles one for free expression in the cyber space, the same privilege can be misused by spreading misleading or false information to incite people for a wrong cause.</p>
<p>Of late computer crime is on the rise. It includes spreading the viruses, looking at information for which one has no entitlement, and hacking or breaking into computer systems. There is also an economic aspect related to computing. Issues such as monopolizing the market space by eliminating competition using unscrupulous means, and controlling supply and demand of work force are in this direction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ClassesOfComputers" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Classes of Computers</h2>
<p>Computers are categorized into two broad groups: special-purpose and general- purpose. <em>Special-purpose computers</em> are specifically designed to solve a pre-determined problem and are optimized for solving that problem. Computers which are part of an <em>embedded system</em> are typically special-purpose type. <em>General-purpose computers</em>, on the other hand, are programmable — they can be made to do things that are not pre-determined. Based on the performance characteristics, size, and cost, general-purpose computers are classified into the following overlapping categories: hand-helds, laptops, notebooks, desktops, servers, workstations, mini-computer, mid-size computer, mainframe computer, and supercomputer.</p>
<div id="hand-held-computers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Hand-Held Computers</h3>
<p><em>Hand-held computers</em> are small in size and are meant for use when away from the office. One type of hand-helds are referred to as <em>Personal Digital Assistants</em> (PDAs). They run personal productivity applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, e-mail, and schedulers. They feature functionality to synchronize their contents with a desktop computer. Another type of hand-held, which is more recent, is called the <em>Tablet PC</em>. It is an advanced (wireless) computing device, bringing together the functionality of a laptop and a PDA.</p>
</div>
<div id="laptop-computers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Laptop Computers</h3>
<p>Laptop computers are small, light weight, full-fledged computers for personal use. They are popular especially among mobile users. More and more workplaces are doing away with the desktop computers in favor of the laptops. This way employees can use the same computer in the office and off-site. <em>Notebooks</em> are predecessors to laptops, and the name is derived from the fact that they look more like (fat Calculus) books in terms of size and perhaps weight.</p>
</div>
<div id="desktop-computers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Desktop Computers</h3>
<p>Desktop computers are, as the name implies, computers whose size allows them to be housed on a desk. They are typically used to run personal productivity software as well as work related applications in a client capacity (i.e., they are used to run applications by connecting to a server computer). PDAs, laptops, and desktops are called <em>personal computers</em> since their use is limited to only one user at a time.</p>
</div>
<div id="server-computers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Server Computers</h3>
<p>Compared to the desktops, <em>server computers</em> have more processing power and disk capacity. They are used to host software applications such as a database management system, web server, file server, and print server. Servers support several concurrent users, who connect to the server from their desktops, laptops, and PDAs. They are expected to function around the clock to assure high availability. Server computers are generally housed in a secure location such as a server room or data center. A <em>data center</em> is a specially designed building or floor for housing computers. It needs ample air conditioning and Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS). Physical access to data centers is secured and controlled.</p>
</div>
<div id="workstations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Workstations</h3>
<p><em>Workstations</em>, though can be used as general-purpose, programmable computers, their design is optimized for a class of applications. To execute these applications very efficiently, they may have specialized processors and I/O devices. For example, a workstation used for graphics and imaging work, needs special circuit boards or processors and high-resolution display devices for speeding up number crunching operations ubiquitous in processing and rendering graphics and images. Workstations are widely used in Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM), Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE), Desktop Publishing, Molecular Modelling, and Drug Design applications. Like personal computers, workstations are meant for single users. However, they are typically interconnected using a Local Area Network (LAN).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Mini-, Mid-, and Mainframe Computers</h3>
<p>The distinction between mini-, mid-size, and <em>mainframe computers</em> is based on the number of concurrent users that can be supported. At one end, mini-computers support hundreds of users, while at the other end, mainframe computers can support thousands of users. This class of computers are characterized by powerful processors, enormous amounts of storage space, and round the clock operation. Since multiple users use these computers, security (who can use the system) and entitlements (who can do what) are of high concern. Like server computers, they are housed in a secure location such as a data center.</p>

<div id="supercomputers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.7</span> Supercomputers</h3>
<p>Supercomputers are the fastest computers and can execute billions of instructions per second. They are used in high-performance computing applications such a nuclear simulation, weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and computational biology. These applications are characterized by the need for extremely fast computation. From the perspective of supporting large number of concurrent users, mainframes are more powerful than the supercomputers. However, supercomputers can execute a single application faster than mainframes. Supercomputers are also housed in a specially designed space. Because of their potential use for military applications, their sale is governed by the United States government export controls.</p>

<div id="SysSoft" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> System Software</h2>
<p>Software is classified into three broad categories: system software, embedded software, and application software. <em>System software</em> includes operating system, compilers, interpreters, assemblers, loaders, linkers, and debuggers. Application software are programs which are designed to solve specific problems and are used by application users. Oracle database management system, Microsoft Word, and  are examples of application software. Embedded software is used in embedded systems and it is permanently ``burned&quot; into Read Only Memory (ROM).</p>
<div id="operating-systems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Operating Systems</h3>
<p>As discussed in Section <a href="Pano.html#OS1">1.1.5</a>, an operating system is a supervisory program which is responsible for running the computer and managing the applications that run on the computer. Operating system makes it easy to use a computer by providing an abstract layer. Every computer comes with an operating system of some sort.</p>
</div>
<div id="compiler-interpreter-and-assembler" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Compiler, interpreter, and Assembler</h3>
<p>A computer can execute programs written in its machine language only. These programs are called machine language programs. Applications are generally developed using a high-level language such as C# and Java. Programs written in high-level languages are also referred to as <em>source code</em>. There are two ways to execute programs written in a high-level language: compilation and interpretation. In the first method, a compiler is used to translate the high-level language program into machine language (also known as the object code). An interpreter translates high-level language program into an intermediate form, which it then executes. No machine language program is generated.</p>
<p>Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted programs since the machine language code produced by the compiler is optimized for execution speed. The advantage of an interpreter is that it does not need to go through the compilation stage during which machine instructions are generated. Compilation process can be time-consuming especially for large programs. In contrast, the interpreter can immediately execute high-level language programs. Interpreters are sometimes used during the development stage of a program, during which it is typical to add small sections at a time and test them quickly. Interpreters are also often used in learning environments since they allow students to program interactively.</p>
<p>An assembly language is similar to machine language except that the former uses symbols in its program statements instead of binary strings. To execute an assembly language program, first it needs to be converted into an equivalent machine language program. <em>Assembler</em> is a program for this task. In other words, an assembler is to an assembly language what a compiler is to a high-level language.</p>
</div>
<div id="loader-and-linker" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Loader and Linker</h3>
<p>A <em>loader</em> is a piece of system software that copies programs from a secondary storage device such as a disk to the main memory, where they can be executed. Each instruction in a machine language program has an address prefixed to it. The address can be thought of a mechanism to uniquely refer to instructions in the program. An instruction references another using its address. Generally the first instruction will have 0 (zero) as its address, the next one will have 1, and so on. Addresses assigned this way are referred to as <em>virtual addresses</em>. In addition to copying a program into main memory, the loader also replaces virtual addresses with physical or real addresses. That is, if the first instruction gets copied to physical address 600, virtual address 0 corresponds to the physical address 600. Physical address of the second instruction is 601, and that of the third is 602, and so on. Most loaders are used by the operating system when needed, and users rarely need to invoke them directly.</p>
<p>A large programming project typically involves several software engineers. Each engineer will work on different pieces of code, called modules. Modules are compiled separately thus resulting in several object modules. A <em>linker</em> is used to combine all these object modules to produce a final executable. This process also requires replacing virtual addresses with physical addresses. Linker is also known as <em>link editor</em>, and <em>binder</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="debugger" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Debugger</h3>
<p>A <em>debugger} is a special program used to find errors (or bugs) in other programs. A debugger allows a programmer to stop a program at any statement using </em>break points* and to examine and change the values of variables. Some debuggers also allow for setting up expressions involving program variables and watching their values as the program executes. Note that a debugger is operating on the machine language program, and not on the source code. A <em>source code-level debugger</em> is one which can help you step through the source program as it executes the object code. This requires the debugger to maintain association between the source code statements in the high-level language program and the associated machine instructions in the object code.</p>
</div>
<div id="utilities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> Utilities</h3>
<p>Utility programs such as e-mail, text editors, hex editors, text processors, spell checkers, and document typesetting also come packaged with an operating system. However, they are not considered as system software. Of late, vendors are unbundling this software from the operating system software as a means to increasing their revenues by separately licensing them.</p>

</div>
<div id="EmbSoft" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Embedded Software</h2>
<p>Embedded system refers to a computer and software which form a component of some other larger system. An embedded system is physically housed in the larger system. Embedded systems are expected to function without human intervention and respond to events in real-time. An embedded system may include some kind of operating system with very small footprint — often written as a single program. It will not usually have any of the normal I/O devices such as keyboard, monitor, mass storage devices attached to it nor feature any kind of user interface software. A typical system is comprised of a single-board microcomputer with software in ROM (Read Only Memory). ROM is a type of data storage device which is manufactured with pre-determined data and software programs. ROM, in contrast to RAM, is non-volatile — retains its contents even when the power is switched off.</p>
<p>Embedded system starts running some special-purpose application program as soon as it is turned on and is typically expected to run forever. Embedded systems abound in practice — in aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, nuclear power plants, and home appliances.</p>

<div id="AppsSoft" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Application Software</h2>
<p>An application program is a software system designed to solve a specific domain problem — for example, payroll, accounts payable, accounts receivable, securities trading, financial portfolio management. They are designed for end users. End users can be human users or other application programs. Application software sits on top of the system software — it needs the services of system software and system utilities in order to run. In the following, we briefly describe some important application software.</p>
<div id="document-preparation-and-desktop-publishing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Document preparation and Desktop Publishing</h3>
<p>Of all the computer applications, document preparation or word processing is the most common. Some users of desktop computers spend more time on document preparation than on any other task. Document preparation and desktop publishing are two distinct but related applications. In document preparation, the goal is to quickly produce a document without undue emphasis on esthetics. Programs such as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect belong to this category. Desktop publishing systems, on the other hand, are used to produce documents that rival in quality with those that are professionally typeset. MS Publisher and Broderbund Software’s PrintShop are low-end desktop publishing systems. The ones on the high-end are Open Software Foundation’s , Adobe PageMaker, Adobe FrameMaker, ArborText’s Epic Editor, and Interleaf, Inc.’s Interleaf.</p>
<p>Common features found in document preparation software include word wrap, insert, delete, cut and paste of text; search and replace, side-by-side editing of multiple documents, font specifications, spell checking and thesaurus, importing graphics, searching files based on their contents; specification of document layout — margins, headers and footers, page numbering style and location; automatic numbering of footnotes, cross referencing, automatic generation of table of contents and index, and printing. Some allow definition of macros. Macros allow recording a series of actions (can be text or commands) and replaying the sequence repeatedly on different parts of the document to save time and to avoid tedium.</p>
<p>Desktop publishing systems provide a full set of features of the document preparation software as well as additional features to provide fine control over placement of text and graphics to enable creating high quality documents such as sales and marketing literature, product white papers, newsletters, and brochures of various sorts. The boundary between the document preparation software and the desktop publishing systems is rather fluid and is constantly shifting with technological advances. Document preparation software is constantly trying to catch up with desktop publishing features, while the latter is relentlessly making new inroads.</p>
<p>In general, a document has two aspects: content and layout. Having a clean separation between the content and layout has several advantages. Authors can focus on the content of the document and its structural composition — for example, a book has several chapters, each chapter has multiple sections, a section has possibly many subsections, and so on. A given content and structural composition can be rendered differently by specifying suitable layout options. Layout options for one-sided printing are different from those for two-sided printing. Of late, there is a need for <em>multichannel publishing</em> — traditional print, Web, CD-ROM, and wireless. Separating the content from the layout naturally lends itself for multichannel publishing.</p>
<p>We can take the concept of separating the content and its structure from the layout a step further. Under this scenario, content, structure, and layout are orthogonal to each other. A document is produced by first selecting the content, specifying structural relationships among the content items, and finally choosing layout options for rendering the document. Content created in Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) format suits this paradigm quite naturally. Large documents that run into millions of pages — aircraft maintenance manuals, for example — are created using this approach. Content is truly treated as a reusable component and its existence is independent of the documents in which it is used.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-and-authoring-software" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Presentation and Authoring Software</h3>
<p>Presentation software is used to create and display highly stylized slides. Basic features include templates and wizards for several classes of presentations, charts and graphs creation, importing graphics, incorporating audio and video clips, formatting and aligning text, spell checker, thesaurus, creating animations and slide shows. Though these presentations can look very sleek, virtually there is no user interactivity. The order in which the slides are shown (navigation path) is pre-defined and hardwired. Changing navigation path to suit a different audience requires physically shuffling the slides, possibly adding some and deleting others since navigation path is simply the physical placement order of the slides in the file. Microsoft PowerPoint is a well-known presentation application.</p>
<p>Software for authoring Computer-Based Training (CBT) courses and e-Books, flexible and interactive delivery of product documentation, diagnostic and trouble shooting manuals, help files, and complex technical documents is also considered as presentation software. Hypertext and hypermedia technologies are often used in these systems.</p>
<p>With the recent emergence and popularity of multimedia personal computers, there has been a tremendous interest in authoring and delivering on-demand, customized, interactive, and compelling multimedia presentations for multichannel delivery. This poses several challenges including assessing the user need and motivation for the presentation, identifying the appropriate content components, determining pre-requisite dependencies between the content components, and assembling a multimedia presentation on the fly considering the constraints on the length of presentation and the delivery channel chosen. Under this scenario, it is imperative that the content is generated and maintained as reusable components with independent existence. Such systems for automated assembly of presentations feature functionality to support multimedia data, built-in interactivity, templates for common tasks, a repertoire of navigational structures including conditional branching, multi platform deployment, and multichannel delivery. Support is also provided for content versioning and for multiple authors collaboratively creating the content. Macromedia is a leading provider of product suites in this area.</p>

<div id="graphics-program" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Graphics Program</h3>
<p>As discussed in Section <a href="Pano.html#GVC">1.1.9</a>, there are four broad categories of graphics software: Paint programs, Presentation graphics, Illustration graphics, and Design graphics. We have also described basic characteristics of these categories of software in that section. Design graphics exemplifies high-performance graphics computing.</p>
<p>There are four distinct tasks in design graphics applications: modeling, geometric processing, rasterization, and display. Modeling, also known as geometric modeling, involves defining the geometry of the object to be designed using 2D and 3D geometric primitives such as point, line, polygon, circle and ellipse, sphere, curved objects, surfaces, and text. To achieve realism, light source, materials, texture mapping are also specified. The type of projection to be used (orthographic, axonometric, oblique), shading model to be used, and the type of view desired (isometric, perspective) are also specified. All this becomes input to the geometric processor which carries out tasks such as hidden line removal, hidden surface removal, clipping, ray tracing to achieve realistic rendering of the object. Rendered object is still in vector format — a line, for example, is defined by its end points, or by the current position and one other point. However, all modern display devices are raster based. Rasterization is the process of taking the rendered object in vector format and translating it into raster format. Once the rasterization is done, the object can be displayed on any raster output device (monitor, printer, plotter).</p>
<p>Geometric processing and rasterization operations are usually implemented in hardware because of their computational intensiveness. Therefore, industry standards are needed for developing portable 2D and 3D graphics applications. OpenGL is such a standard introduced in 1992. It features a rich and versatile application programming interface (API) and brought thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. The API provides access to geometric and image primitives, modelling transformations, lighting and texturing, anti-aliasing, blending, among others.</p>
<p>Every conforming OpenGL implementation includes the full complement of OpenGL functions. OpenGL standard has language bindings for C, C++, FORTRAN, Ada, and Java. Applications utilizing the OpenGL functions are easily portable across a wide array of platforms. Silicon Graphics, Inc. is a premier provider of graphics workstations. Several vendors supply OpenGL API implementation and bindings for popular languages on different platforms.</p>

<div id="image-processing-software" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4</span> Image Processing Software</h3>
<p>Image processing, computer graphics, and visualization are closely related <a href="Pano.html#GVC">1.1.9</a>. Computer graphics is concerned with the generation of artifical images. Image processing, on the other hand, deals with processing, enhancing analyzing, and understanding images. These images are not artificial. They correspond to real objects or observed phenomenon. Visualization’s goal is to help understand real-world data collected in numeric or image forms.</p>
<div id="image-acquisition-and-representation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.4.1</span> Image Acquisition and Representation</h4>
<p>Images are typically obtained by air-borne sensors, areal photography, cameras, frame grabber, scanner, and remote sensing satellites. Some of these are taken in less than ideal conditions. Several corrections are applied to remove ``noise&quot; introduced into the images. Some of the corrections are performed in <em>spatial domain</em> and others are carried out in <em>frequency domain</em>. In the spatial domain, an image representation is composed of pixels arranged in a rectangular array of certain width and height. <em>Resolution</em> of an image corresponds to the width and height of the rectangular array.<em>Pixel depth</em> refers to the number of bits used to represent pixel values. Each pixel represents the brightness of the image at that point and possibly including color information encoded as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) triples. The more the pixel depth, the larger is the range of values which can be used to represent pixel depth — contributes to image quality. Space required to store an image is a function of the resolution and pixel depth.</p>
<p>A frequency domain representation is obtained by applying discrete 2D Fourier transform, for example, on the spatial domain representation. Certain tasks which are difficult or computationally expensive in the spatial domain become easier or computationally less expensive in the frequency domain. Using the inverse Fourier transform, the spatial domain representation can be recovered from the frequency domain representation. Frequency domain representations are often used to reduce storage requirements, especially when images are transmitted.</p>
<p>Image processing software is usually available as a library of functions implementing the various algorithms including convolution (on which many others are based), Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), segmentation, thinning (or skeletonization), edge detection, and contrast enhancement. These are usually implemented in software but may also use special purpose hardware for speed. Many of these algorithms are used for higher level tasks such as image enhancement, restoration, compression and decompression, object recognition, and image interpretation.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics manufactures workstations which are often used for image processing. There are a few programming languages designed for image processing including CELIP and VPL.</p>

<div id="visualization-software" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.5</span> Visualization Software</h3>
<p>Visualization is of great interest in engineering, physical sciences, and medicine. Visualization is used as an effective tool to communicate the knowledge hidden in numbers and mathematical models. The core principles are centered around selecting and arranging image components: color, gray scale, black and white; line types; text for annotation; and background. Effective and limited use of color is important to achieve a visualization goal. Lines can be effective in promoting understanding of the image by delineating object boundaries or regions. Textual annotation of the image should be minimal, otherwise the adage ``a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; is defeated. When properly used, background enhances, supports, and highlights the main components in the image.</p>
<p>Like graphics and image processing software, visualization software is computationally intensive, and requires specialized workstations. Most of the visualization work is done at national laboratories of the Department of Energy, NASA, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.6</span> Mathematical Software</h3>
<p>Mathematics is a universal language and transcends almost all the disciplines. Mathematical software is widely used for doing mathematics symbolically and numerically, and for exploring and visualizing abstract concepts. It varies in scope and sophistication from being mathematical libraries for a specific subject area of mathematics to comprehensive embodiment of mathematical knowledge.</p>
<div id="characterizing-mathematical-software" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.6.1</span> Characterizing Mathematical Software</h4>
<p>Mathematical software is characterized by using the following facets: coverage scope, access mode, extensibility, interoperability, importing and exporting, visualization, and application development.</p>
<p><em>Scope of coverage</em> is determined by which of the following topics (not comprehensive) are addressed and to what degree: Symbolic Algebra — symbolic math with real and complex numbers, and polynomials, factoring, expansion, and combination, simplification of algebraic expressions and polynomials; Calculus — derivatives, integrals, and limits; Differential Equations — exact and numerical solutions; Partial Differential Equations; Linear Algebra — matrix operations, Eigen vectors and Eigen values; Vector Calculus; Euclidian Geometry; Financial Mathematics; Number, Graph, and Group Theories; Statistical and Data Analysis.</p>
<p><em>Access mode</em> refers to different ways of making use of the software. Some provide libraries, and the functions in the library are invoked from a C or C++ program using the syntax and semantics of library’s Application Programming Interface (API). Others feature a GUI-based workbench within which all the computations are performed. Access through the workbench is ideal for interactive exploration and visualization. Leading mathematical software vendors provide both types of access.</p>
<p><em>Extensibility</em> refers to how the users can extend the functionality of the system. Some systems allow users to add additional capability by developing new programs using the vendor supplied Software Development Kit (SDK). User added functionality seamlessly coexists and is transparent to the other users.</p>
<p><em>Interoperability</em> refers to the mechanisms available in the system to interact with other applications. Some systems allow calling external procedures and integrating with the functionality featured in third-party component-based software.</p>
<p><em>Importing</em> and <em>exporting</em> refers to the aspects of the system that enable importing data from and exporting data to other applications. MathML is an emerging standard for these tasks.</p>
<p><em>Visualization</em> is an integral component of mathematical software to visualize data, concept exploration, and to make the abstract concrete. Graphing, 2D and 3D plotting, different coordinate systems, animation, standard geometric objects, regular solids and polyhedra, and lighting models are functional components featured under visualization.</p>
<p><em>Applications development</em> aspect refers to the availability of tools and programming environments for developing specific applications using the mathematical software.</p>

<div id="spreadsheet-software" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.7</span> SpreadSheet Software</h3>
<p>A spreadsheet is a table of values arranged in rows and columns. Each value in the table is referred to as a cell. A cell is constrained to store values of certain data type only — integers, strings, floating point numbers, dates. Font and formatting information can also be associated with cell data. For example, there are multiple formats to display a date: June 15, 2002; Jun 15, 2004; 06-15-2004; and 15-06-2004. Existence of cells in isolation has only a limited value such as to display information formatted attractively in a tabular format.</p>
<div id="cross-linking-of-cells" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.7.1</span> Cross Linking of Cells</h4>
<p>What makes a spreadsheet computationally useful is the ability to link a cell with several other cells. For example, the value of a cell can be expressed as a formula composed of values of other cells. If the value of any of the cells participating in a formula changes, the value of the cell gets computed automatically. This capability is used to study “what-if” scenarios. Consider the task of computing a mortgage payment for a home. The variables are cost of the house, down payment amount, mortgage rate, length of the loan, and monthly payment. Monthly payment cell value is expressed as a formula in which the values of the cells corresponding to cost of the house, down payment amount, mortgage rate, and length of the loan are variables. The effect of down payment amount, mortgage rate, and length of the loan on monthly payment can be assessed by varying the values for the down payment, mortgage rate, and length of the loan and noting the change in the monthly payment.</p>
</div>
<div id="features" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.7.2</span> Features</h4>
<p>Spreadsheets programs also provide an assortment of features: copy, cut, and past of blocks of data, edit and validate checks on cell data, spell checker and thesaurus, generating charts and graphs from the data in the spreadsheet, importing data and graphics, conditional formatting of data (e.g., color coding to classify data or to indicate exceptions), sort and filter data, grouping and subtotals. A vast array of functions are also available for use in formula specification. There are financial functions (e.g., straight-line depreciation, net present value, future value, internal rate of return), date and time functions (e.g., date and time arithmetic, converting a text string to date format), mathematical and trigonometric functions (e.g., Sin, Cos, rounding, factorial, logarithmic, combinations and permutations), statistical functions (e.g., mean, mode, average, standard deviation, variance), and string functions (e.g., substrings, searching for string patterns using regular expressions). Spreadsheets usually incorporate a macro language, by which a sequence of actions can be recorded and played back under a macro name to avoid tedium and to save time. Macro language is also used to write user-defined functions from scratch or by composing the functions that come with the system.</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel is arguably the most popular and widely used spreadsheet software. It is completely programmable using a macro language or another language known as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Using VBA, one can program Excel to communicate with other programs in the Microsoft Office suite — Word, Access, PowerPoint, and Project. The computational paradigm featured in spreadsheets is simple, yet powerful. Because of this and familiarity of the Excel user interface to the masses, spreadsheet computational paradigm has been adopted in designing user interfaces for several business and scientific applications.</p>

A company’s e-mail system scope may be limited to within the company or world-wide. In the first scenario, e-mails can be delivered to recipients within the company. In the latter case, the company’s e-mail system is connected to other e-mail gateways so that the messages can be sent to users world-wide.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.8.1</span> E-mail Message Structure</h4>
<p>An e-mail message consists of two parts: header and body. <em>Header</em> comprises the name and e-mail address of both the sender and the receiver, time and date when it was sent, and subject. Other headers may get added by different message handling systems during the course of transmission and delivery. Message body is separated from the header by a blank line.<em>Message body</em> can contain not only text but also multimedia data such as audio, video, images, fax messages as <em>attachments</em>. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a standard governing the contents of e-mail message body.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.8.2</span> Mail System Component</h4>
<p>An end user program which is used to compose, send, receive, read, forward, and delete e-mail messages is called <em>Mail User Agent</em> (MUA). Popular MUAs for UNIX include elm, mush, pine, and RMAIL; for Microsoft Windows, it is Outlook. After a message is composed, it is handed over by MUA to another program known as <em>Message Transfer Agent</em> (MTA). MTA directly delivers the message if the recipient is local (i.e., within the jurisdiction of MTA). Otherwise, it hands off the message to another MTA on another computer.</p>
<p>MTAs communicate using a protocol known as <em>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</em> (SMTP). The actual message is transported from point to point by a program called the <em>sendmail</em>, which is used in over 75% of all Internet mail servers.

<div id="data-models" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.1</span> Data models</h4>
<p>As discussed in Section <a href="Pano.html#IE">1.1.11</a>, a data model is an abstraction for describing information elements, their characteristics, semantics and constraints, and relationships among the elements. There are two categories of data models: logical and physical. Logical models describe the data at a logical or conceptual level. Logical data models are further categorized into object- based and record-based.</p>
<p><em>Object-based logical data models</em> feature flexible and intuitive constructs for modelling the data and allow for explicit specification of data semantics and constraints. Entity-Relationship (ER) model and object-oriented (OO) data model are well-known in this category. Of the two, the ER model is widely used in practice.</p>
<p>In contrast to the object-based logical models, <em>record-based logical models</em> are used to specify the structure of the data as well as higher level implementation details. Hierarchical, network, and relational models (in historical order) are the most widely used record-based logical models. Under these models the database is structured as a fixed-format records of several types. Each record type is composed of a fixed number of attributes. Relational data model has taken over the hierarchical and network models in recent years. However, the latter are still abound in older or legacy database systems.</p>
<p><em>Physical data models</em> are used to describe the data at the lowest level.<em>Unifying model</em> and <em>frame-memory model</em> are two such models</p>

<div id="er-data-model" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.2</span> ER Data Model</h4>
<p>From the ER model perspective, a domain of discourse consists of a collection of basic objects known as <em>entities</em>. Entities are characterized by one or more <em>attributes</em>. For example, in the university domain, <em>Student</em> and <em>Section</em> are two entities. <em>Student</em> entity is characterized by attributes such as first name, last name, classification, major, date of birth, social security number, and GPA. Attributes course ID, section ID, credit hours completed, semester, year, time, days, and room number characterize the <em>Section</em> entity. Assignment of values to the attributes of <em>Student</em> entity results in an <em>instance</em> of <em>Student</em> entity. Thus, an entity can have many instances. Entities by themselves are not very useful. It is relationships between entities that makes the data more useful. The information that a student can enroll in multiple sections and a section has multiple students is a <em>many-to-many</em> relationship information between the entities <em>Student</em> and <em>Section</em>. Information such as a student should enroll in at least one section and that a section needs at least five students specifies <em>constraints</em> on the relationship. ER models shown graphically are referred to as <em>ER diagram</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="oo-data-model" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.3</span> OO Data Model</h4>
<p>Object-oriented (OO) model is based on the notion of objects. An object is similar to an instance of an entity in the ER model. An object is characterized by a set of instance variables (or attributes) and the values of the instance variables are stored within the object. While instance variables specify the structure of an object, a set of methods specify the behavior or functional capability of an object. Objects that have the same instance variables and methods are grouped together into <em>classes</em>. A new class (known as derived class) can be obtained from an existing class (referred to as base class) through a mechanism known as <em>inheritance</em>. Derived classes inherit all the structure and functionality of the base class, and can add additional structure and functionality as needed. Inheritance can be extended to any number of levels. One aspect of inheritance is to promote reuse of classes. Classes are also related through each other via various types of associations or relationships.</p>

<div id="hierarchical-and-network-data-models" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.4</span> Hierarchical and Network Data Models</h4>
<p><em>Hierarchical data models</em> are suitable for applications in which data is inherently hierarchical. For example, an enterprise is structured into various divisions, a division has several departments, and each department has several employees. A domain is modeled as a collection of hierarchies: one for organizational structure, other for product organization, and so on. If we allow a node in a tree structure can have more than one parent, we get a <em>network data model</em> in the form of a graph structure. User queries are answered in hierarchical and network data models by traversing the tree and graph structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="relational-data-model" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.5</span> Relational Data Model</h4>
<p>Table is the prime data structure in the relational model. A table corresponds to either an entity or a many-to-many relationship in the ER model. A table can have multiple columns and column names within a table are unique. One or more columns of a table are designated as <em>primary key</em> of the table. No two rows in the table can have the same values for the primary key columns. This is one type of constraint known as <em>primary key constraint</em>. In other words, values of primary key columns are used to uniquely identify a row in the table. A table can have only one primary key.</p>
<p>Relational model also allows other types of constraints on table columns. A <em>uniqueness</em> constraint is specified on one or more columns. Uniqueness constraint specifies that no two rows in the table can have the same values for the columns comprising the uniqueness constraint. <em>Check constraint</em> is another type of constraint which is used to specify that a column can only assume values from a pre-defined set of values. Constraints can also be specified between tables. Such a constraint is referred to as <em>referential integrity constraint</em>. Think of a scenario where a (child) table uses data which actually belongs to another table (parent table). Referential integrity constraint insures that the data exists first in the parent table before the child table can use or refer to it.</p>
<p><em>Indexes</em> are a mechanism available in relational databases to speed up access to table data.</p>

<div id="ddl-and-dml" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.6</span> DDL and DML</h4>
<p><em>Data Definition Language</em> (DDL) specifies precise syntax and semantics for creating tables, specifying constraints, and creating indexes. It is also used to specify parameters for storing the table data — how much of disk space should be reserved when the table is first created, increment size for requesting additional space as the table grows, etc. Unlike the other record- based logical models, queries on the relational databases are specified using Data Manipulation Language (DML) declaratively: <em>what</em> data is needed as apposed to <em>how</em> to retrieve the data. Structured Query Language (SQL) is an industry standard language used in relational databases as DDL and DML.</p>

<div id="logical-and-physical-database-design" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.7</span> Logical and Physical Database Design</h4>
<p><em>Logical database design</em> (in relational model context) focuses on information sufficiency for a given application and insures that the tables are structured in a way to guarantee certain anomalies associated with insert and update operations don’t exist and storing multiple copies of the same data across multiple tables is minimized. <em>Physical database design</em> is concerned with choosing proper storage structures and associated parameters for storing table data, and providing appropriate index structures to optimize access to the data.</p>
</div>
<div id="transactions-and-concurrency-control" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.8</span> Transactions and Concurrency Control</h4>
<p>A <em>transaction</em> is a logical unit of work at the application level. However, a transaction when executed by a DBMS may result in multiple operations at the database level. A transaction manager insures that all operations associated with a single transaction succeed as a unit. If any one of the operations fail, the transaction manager will nullify the effect of previously executed operations related to the transaction. This notion of <em>all or none</em> is critical to insuring data integrity.</p>
<p><em>Concurrency control</em> function insures that the effect on the database by a set of concurrently executing transactions is same as that effected by serially executing the transactions in the set in some order. Concurrency control helps to increase the database throughput (i.e., number of transaction executed in unit time) while guaranteeing data integrity.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-warehousing-and-data-mining" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.9</span> Data Warehousing and Data Mining</h4>
<p>Large organizations typically have hundreds of databases scattered across various departments. These databases are designed to meet functional needs of individual departments. However, making decisions at the organizational level requires an integrated access the departmental databases. <em>Data warehousing</em> is an approach to integrating data from multiple, often disparate data sources (i.e., databases based on different data models, legacy applications, flat files).</p>
<p>The goal of <em>data mining</em> is to discover implicit patterns in the data. Knowledge derived from such patterns can be used, for example, to promote sales, and to improve customer shopping experience. Suppose data mining revealed a pattern on retail transactional data: whenever a customer bought item <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the customer also bought item <span class="math inline">\(y.\)</span> Such knowledge can be used to put item <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on sale so that item <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be disposed off quickly. The same knowledge can also be used to shelve items <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> next to each other to improve customer shopping experience.</p>

<div id="oltp-and-olap" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.10</span> OLTP and OLAP</h4>
<p>Database applications are classified into two broad categories: <em>on-line transaction processing</em> (OLTP) and <em>on-line analytical processing</em>. OLTP applications are characterized by a large number of concurrent transactions and the design goal is to increase the system throughput. OLAP applications, on the other hand, are designed to support decision making processes at management levels. OLAP queries tend to retrieve and process large amounts of data. Therefore, efficient algorithms for query evaluation and query optimization are of paramount importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-and-parallel-databases" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.9.11</span> Distributed and Parallel Databases</h4>
<p>As more and more companies become global, distributed databases are gaining importance. The idea is to fragment and distribute the data in such a way to improve the database performance. However, the fragmentation and distribution should be transparent to the database users. For example, let us say that a company has 100,000 employees, out of which 50,000 work in North America, 10,000 work in Europe, and the remaining work in Asia. It is beneficial from performance point of view, to fragment the data based on geographic regions and create separate databases for managing the fragments. Though this results in three separate physical databases, from the users point of view there is only one logical database.</p>
<p>Parallel database systems are enjoying a renaissance due to tremendous interest in OLAP applications. Their goal is to decrease the query execution time and thus improve system response time by various means. Parallelism is also used to provide <em>scalability</em> — ability of the system to handle increased workloads without an increase in response time</p>

<div id="multimedia-information-retrieval" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10</span> Multimedia Information Retrieval</h3>
<p>Multimedia data encompasses text, graphics, animation, images, audio, and video. The availability of inexpensive and powerful devices for capturing multimedia data has resulted in large repositories. Multimedia information retrieval systems are required to effectively utilize information from these repositories. Functionality of such systems include processing the data to extract information content, structuring and organizing the information content, and processing user queries using the extracted information content.</p>
<div id="challenges-in-multimedia-information-retrieval" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10.1</span> Challenges in Multimedia Information Retrieval</h4>
<p>Unlike structured data managed by the DBMS, multimedia data poses several challenges. The first issue is in determining what information content in the data is significant in processing user queries. For example, different people will characterize the information content of an image differently. The next issue is how to automatically extract the information content. Despite several years of research in this area, no significant inroads have been made due to intrinsically difficult nature of the problem. Then there is the issue of devising suitable algorithms for processing user queries. Due to the inherent subjectivity in interpreting the image contents, the same query posed by different users need to be processed by taking their subjectivity into consideration by reformulating the query using techniques such as <em>relevance feedback</em>.</p>
<p>Multimedia information retrieval is a fascinating area and is in its infancy. In the interest of space, we illustrate retrieval issues in the context of text and images. Text is an example of unstructured data. Traditionally, text retrieval problem has been referred to as <em>information retrieval</em> (IR). IR problem is characterized by a collection of documents, possibly distributed, and a set of users who perform queries on the collection to identify a subset of the documents. This typifies the process you go through in identifying relevant literature for a term paper. Contrast this with the database querying where the query specification is precise and database records are unambiguously characterized by a set of attributes. Users expect retrieved database records to meet the query criteria precisely. On the other hand, database type of retrieval is difficult in IR systems for the following reasons.</p>
</div>
<div id="indexing-problem" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10.2</span> Indexing Problem</h4>
<p><em>Indexing</em> is the process of developing document representation by assigning content descriptors. Index terms are used in assessing the relevance of a document to a query. Retrieval effectiveness is primarily dependent on the quality of indexing.</p>
<p>There are two types of index terms: objective and non-objective. <em>Objective terms</em> are extrinsic to the document content and generally there is no disagreement about how to assign them. Examples of objective terms include author name, document title, and publication date.<em>Non-objective terms</em>, on the other hand, are intended to represent the information content of the document. There is no agreement on the choice of terms as well as to what degree the chosen terms reflect the information content. Non-objective terms are called <em>content terms</em> and indexing is assigning content terms to document. Optionally, a weight can be associated with a content term to indicate its importance or relevance in reflecting the information content.</p>
</div>
<div id="ir-models" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10.3</span> IR Models</h4>
<p>There exists several IR models. An IR model is characterized by four parameters: representation chosen for documents and user queries, strategies for matching query representations with document representations, ranking the query output, and methods employed for acquiring relevance feedback. Unlike the database query results where every record is equally relevant, query output in IR systems need to be ranked based on their <em>estimated</em> relevance to the user query. Because of the issues that result as a consequence of subjectivity and impreciseness inherent in assigning content terms, IR systems often reformulate the query based on user feedback on the initial results and reexecute the query to improve retrieval effectiveness.</p>
<p>Retrieval effectiveness is characterized by precision and recall. <em>Recall</em> is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of relevant documents in the collection. <em>Precision</em> is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved.</p>
<p>IR models are classified into four categories: set theoretic, algebraic, probabilistic, and hybrid models. Boolean model is an example of set theoretic IR model. It represents documents by a set of index terms, each of which is viewed as a Boolean variable and is valued <em>true</em> if it is present in a document. No weights are allowed for index terms. Queries are specified as arbitrary boolean expressions formed by linking terms through the standard logical operators: AND, OR, and NOT. Retrieval status value (RSV) is a measure of the query-document similarity. RSV equals 1 if the query expression evaluates to 1; RSV is zero otherwise. All documents whose RSV evaluates to 1 are considered relevant to the query.</p>
<p>Vector space model is an algebraic IR model. It is based on the premise that documents in a collection can be represented by a set of vectors in a space spanned by a set of normalized (index) term vectors. If the vector space is spanned by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> normalized term vectors, then each document will be represented by an <span class="math inline">\(n-\)</span>dimensional vector. The value of the first component in this vector reflects the weight of the term in the document corresponding to the first dimension of the vector space, and so forth. A user query is similarly represented by an <span class="math inline">\(n-\)</span>dimensional vector. A query-document’s RSV is given by the scalar product of the query and document vectors. The higher the RSV, the greater is the document’s relevance to the query.</p>
<p>Extended boolean model is an example of a hybrid model. As in the case of the vector-space model, the extended boolean model represents a document as a vector in a space spanned by a set of orthonormal term vectors. However, it measures query-document similarity by using a generalized scalar product between the corresponding vectors in the document space.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10.4</span> IR Software</h4>
<p>IR software vendors include Excaliber Technologies, Excite, Inc., Fulcrum Technologies, and Open Text Corporation. At the heart of Web search engines is an IR system. Digital Libraries is an application area where IR systems have been extensively used. Oracle, a commercial relational DBMS, provides text indexing, search, and analysis through a feature known as <em>Oracle Text</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="image-retrieval" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.10.5</span> Image Retrieval</h4>
<p>Text retrieval is quite advanced compared to image retrieval. Automatically assigning index terms to text documents is routinely done whereas, the same for images is far from being a reality. Existing image retrieval system have used color and texture as content descriptors simply because they are amenable for automatic extraction. However, they perform quite poorly in retrieval task. Often text is associated with images as captions and narrative. In such situations, IR techniques are used to retrieve images based on text, complementing retrieval by color and texture. For example, diagnostic medical images are retrieved not only based on the image contents but also based on other information associated with the images — text describing physician’s diagnosis, treatment plan and the final outcome. Hence, from the physician’s view point, the text associated with diagnostic medical images is as important as the contents of the image itself.</p>
<p>Research in image retrieval area has identified several generic query classes for content-based image retrieval (CBIR): query by color, texture, text, shape similarity; spatial similarity — similarity based on directional and topological relationships between the objects in the image. It should be emphasized that true CBIR can only be achieved by synergistically employing various generic query classes in a way transparent to the system user. In other words, high-level user queries need to be expressed as a composition of the generic query classes in a domain-independent way without the involvement of the system user. Video retrieval issues encompass those of CBIR plus additional ones introduced by the spatio-temporal dimension.</p>
<p>Virage, Inc. develops and markets CBIR software. Retrieval is primarily based on color and texture. QBIC (Query By Image Content) is an IBM technology for retrieving images based on text, color, and texture. QBIC technology is made available in IBM’s relational database DB2 as DB2 Image Extender.</p>

<p>A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying <em>geo-referenced</em> data — data that is tied to spatial locations which are represented by geographic coordinates. GIS data is typically stored as a series of layers. Each layer is depicted as a map and represents geographic features such as soil type, vegetation, annual rainfall, demographics, roads, for example. Each feature is linked to a position on the geographical image of a map — for example, population of a city</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.11.1</span> GIS Use</h4>
<p>GIS uses are primarily government related including municipal planning, public utility management, environmental protection, natural resources management, and emergency planning.

Police departments use GISs to determine the emergency vehicle routes and to compute spatial crime statistics. The census bureau uses GIS to map census data and to statistically analyze the data. Businesses use GIS to determine ideal locations for new stores based on location of competitors, areas of potential customers and their demographics, projected population growth rates, and transportation networks. Geo Positioning System (GPS) in conjunction with a GIS is used in automobile navigation systems.</p>

<div id="enterprise-resource-planning-systems" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.12</span> Enterprise Resource Planning Systems</h3>
<p>Software development is time consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Cost overruns, slipping delivery dates, poor quality, functionally deficient, brittle and unstable are the terms often used to describe the experiences with or outcome of software development projects. Furthermore, software needs to be maintained — fixing bugs as they are uncovered in the field. Software needs to be evolved – add additional functionality to accommodate new business requirements.</p>
<p>Many companies got disenchanted with the glamor of software development as the promised return on investment was nowhere in sight. Around the same time, some saw a pattern in software development projects across the industry. Company after company was doing the same type of software projects and going through the same frustration and despair. They all need systems for manufacturing — material resource planning, inventory control, distribution and warehousing, sales and marketing; accounting — payroll, accounts receivable, accounts payable; human resources — issuing paychecks, administering employee benefits. Companies such as SAP, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, Oracle, and Bann develop generic systems for these functions — Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Since each company’s business processes, policies and procedures are different, ERP systems are customizable via configuration and extensibility.</p>
<p>ERP systems became an instant success in the early 1990s. Several large companies jumped on the ERP bandwagon. Companies license ERP products from the vendors and <em>implement</em> these systems. Implementation refers to installing the generic ERP system and configuring it to reflect the business processes of the company. Figuratively speaking, implementing an ERP system is turning each functional knob of the system to point to certain orientation so that collectively the knob orientations reflect the business processes of the organization.</p>
<p>Though several large ERP implementations were successful, it came with a heavy price — implementation costs were an order of magnitude greater than the license costs, and maintenance was a huge recurring expense. There were also instances where many implementations were abruptly aborted. Now companies are showing due diligence and caution in assessing the cost effectiveness of ERP systems. This trend is typical of new technologies, where the reality sets in after a brief period of initial exuberance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.13</span> World-Wide Web Related Software</h3>
<p>We categorize Web related software into two groups: those that are fundamental to enabling Web based computing paradigm and those that are regarded as tools to help build web based applications. In the first category are Web servers and Web browsers.</p>
<div id="web-server-and-web-browser" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.13.1</span> Web Server and Web Browser</h4>
<p>A Web server is a <em>server process</em> that keeps continuously listening to information requests from clients. Users communicate with the Web server using another program known as Web browser. A browser communicates with the server using a protocol referred to as HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol). Typically browsers request documents from the Web server. Therefore, a browser usually provides the name of the document that it is requesting. In response, the Web server may simply return a pre-assembled document (also known as a Web page) housed in the server. Such documents are known as <em>static Web pages</em> since their structure and content are determined <em>a priori</em> regardless of who is going to use it.</p>
<p>Web pages are authored using a language known as <em>HTML</em> (HyperText Markup Language). HTML comes with a pre-determined set of markup <em>tags</em>. The tags indicate how an HTML document should be rendered for display by the Web browser. There are tags to indicate document title, multiple levels of headings (heading, subheading, sub subheading, and so on). Such tags implicitly designate formatting information — font name, size, type, and color. Tags are also available to indicate formatting information for text that appears in the document body. More importantly, HTML documents can have <em>hyperlinks</em> — a reference from some point in the HTML document to another place within the same document or to a point in another document. A browser usually displays a hyperlink using special formatting. When a user clicks (or activates) on a hyperlink, the browser will display the document pointed to by the hyperlink.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamic-web-pages" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.13.2</span> Dynamic Web Pages</h4>
<p>In the early days of Web computing, Web servers primarily provided static Web pages. This was quite useful in disseminating information for public consumption such as technical reports, information about an organization, and its products and services. However, the popularity of Web was so high that it became imperative to explore means to make the Web pages more useful in a business context. The concept of <em>dynamic Web pages</em> was born. Unlike static Web pages, dynamic Web pages are constructed on the fly and contain information which is relevant and customized to the requester’s need. Under this scenario, a browser request will not only name a Web page that needs to be retrieved but also provide necessary parameters to help dynamically generate the page. For example, in an application that provides real-time stock quotes, the parameter will indicate the ticker symbol of the stock. Dynamic Web page generation concept became the seed for electronic business (e-business) or electronic commerce (e-commerce) — selling goods and services using the Web as a channel. Amazon.com pioneered on-line bookstore concept using e-commerce technologies.</p>
<p>A new set of tools were introduced to help develop and maintain Web sites. A Web site refers to a collection of things — the computer on which the Web server runs, the Web server, a collection of static Web pages, and optionally additional software or applications to generate dynamic Web pages. ASP.NET from Microsoft and JSP (Java Server Pages) from Sun Microsystems are two widely used technologies for developing dynamic Web sites. Other popular Web related software include e-mail systems (e.g., Yahoo Mail, Hotmail), Web search engines (e.g., AltaVista, Google, Excite), chat programs, and instant messengers.</p>

<div id="division-of-labor---thin-and-thick-clients" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.5.13.3</span> Division of Labor - Thin and Thick Clients</h4>
<p>In pre-Web era, applications are generally based on an architecture known as <em>client-server</em>. Application functionality is split between two pieces of software referred to as client and server. There are several scenarios for this division of labor. In one scenario, sever does most of the work and the client simply provides user interface for end users to request the functionality of the server. Such clients are called <em>thin clients</em>. Under another scenario, server provides essential services such as accessing the database and implements some of the business functions. Client requests the server for necessary data and performs all computations by itself. Such clients are called <em>fat</em> or <em>thick clients</em>.</p>
<p>Advantages of thin client is that since all the business rules and application logic is concentrated in the server software, maintenance and new software releases is limited to just the server machine. Of course, client software needs to be installed on every end user’s desktop. However, client software doesn’t change or needs maintenance as frequently as the server side. On the flip side, thin clients depend on the server for just about anything and thus server may become the bottleneck, making it difficult to scale — ability to accommodate a large number of concurrent users. Thick client scenario reduces the load on the server and scales easily. However, a significant problem is concerned with deployment and maintenance. Bug fix or enhancement releases need to be installed on every end user computer. Think of the effort when your users are situated in multiple locations around the globe.</p>
<p>In between the thin and thick client scenarios, one can come up with other possibilities. Web-based applications aim at overcoming problems associated with both the thin client and thick client architectures. For these applications, client is always a Web browser (corresponds to thin client architecture). Thick client scenario is effected in Web based applications by using what is termed browser plug-ins.<em>Browser plug-ins</em> are programs that seamlessly execute within a browser to introduce application-specific functionality into the browser. Plug-ins are hosted on the Web server and automatically get downloaded to the client the first time as well as subsequently whenever a new version of the plug-in becomes available on the Web server. Plug-ins are a means to address deployment and maintenance problems associated with fat clients in client-server based systems. Because of these benefits of Web-based applications, most new systems developed today are rooted in Web-based architectures. It is also not uncommon to re-engineer existing systems to bring them from the client-server world into the Web world.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Overview of Programming Languages</h2>
<p>There is an array of programming languages available today for solving problems using a computer. Each language is designed for solving a class of problems. The programming constructs featured by a language for expressing the solution to a problem are directly influenced by the type and abstraction level of the computational steps that are common to the class of problems for which the language is designed. In other words, the language constructs and abstraction mechanisms constrain how a solution to a problem is expressed — that is, the language prescribes the programming paradigm. Programming paradigms are discussed in Section <a href="Pano.html#ProgParadigms">1.7</a>.</p>
<p>Only a small subset of the real world problems are amenable for solution using a computer —- <em>algorithmic problems</em> (see Section <a href="#WhatIsPS"><strong>??</strong></a>. The first step in solving an algorithmic problem is to design the algorithm. This is referred to as <em>algorithmic solution</em>. The next step is to express the algorithmic solution using an appropriate language so that it can be executed by a computer. There exists several (programming) languages for this purpose. An algorithmic solution expressed in a programming language is referred to as a <em>computer program</em> or simply a <em>program</em>.</p>
<p>Programming languages are differentiated by the programming constructs or control structures they feature, availability of various abstract mechanisms for encapsulating software complexity, and data types, among other things. <em>Language constructs</em> or <em>control structures</em> are the building blocks of the language to encode algorithms (discussed in Chapter <a href="#CS"><strong>??</strong></a>. There are three fundamental control structures: sequence, conditional execution, and iteration. The <em>sequence</em> control structure denotes that the steps in a computer program are executed in the order of their physical placement in the program. <em>Conditional execution</em> allows for executing one or more steps in the program contingent upon conditions associated with the construct being true. Using the <em>iterative</em> control structure, one or more steps of a program can be executed over and over as long as a specified conditions remain true. There are multiple variations of the last two fundamental control structures.</p>
<div id="computational-completeness-and-equivalance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Computational Completeness and Equivalance</h3>
<p><em>Computational completeness</em> of a language refers to the fact that the language is expressive enough to express any solution to an algorithmic problem. A language is computationally complete if it supports all the three fundamental control structures. Two languages are <em>computationally equivalent</em> if they feature the three fundamental control structures. In other words, if an algorithmic problem can be solved using one language, the same problem can also be solved using the other language as well.</p>
<p>Certain languages are more appropriate than others for solving a given algorithmic problem. In such cases, the preferred languages have features that are more natural and elegant to express the algorithmic solution. For example, a language may have control structures that are either variations of the fundamental ones or derived by composing the fundamental ones in some fashion so that the resulting control structures have direct correspondence to the algorithmic steps. In such cases, expressing an algorithm in the language is a straightforward process. Otherwise, expressing an algorithmic step may require employing a composition of the fundamental control structures. APL (A Programming Language) language aptly illustrates the case in point. It is designed to manipulate vectors. Adding two vectors in APL is just one assignment statement whereas the same task requires an assignment statement embedded in iteration control structure in programming languages such as C.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> Programming languages Continuum</h3>
<p>Programming languages vary in features widely. They can be best thought of as points on a continuum. At one end of this continuum are machine languages and at the other end are fourth-generation languages (see Sections <a href="Pano.html#PL1">1.1.7</a> and <a href="Pano.html#SysSoft">1.3</a>. Above the machine language is assembly language, and high-level languages are above assembly languages.</p>

<div id="language-elements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.3</span> Language Elements</h3>
<p>Viewed abstractly, a computer program is just one large string. The string is broken down into components and components are further broken down into subcomponents, and so on to assess the syntactic and sematic correctness of the program. Rules of syntax define the language grammar — govern how smaller language elements are combined to form larger language elements. Syntax rules are described using a notation referred to as <em>Backus-Naur Form</em> (BNF) (discussed in Sections <a href="c-basics.html#SyntaxSemantics">3.1</a> and <a href="c-basics.html#EBNF">3.2</a>. The lowest element types of a language are called <em>words</em> or <em>tokens</em>. Some of these words are predefined and are referred to as <em>keywords</em> or <em>reserved words</em>. The lowest computational unit in a program is called a <em>statement</em> and its types include <em>assignment</em>, <em>IF<span class="math inline">\(\cdots\)</span>THEN</em>, among others. Control structures define rules for flow of control in executing the statements in a program. A program uses <em>variables</em> to store results of computational steps which appear in program statements. A variable has a type associated with it. The type determines what type of data the variable can hold and permissible operations on the variable. A variable whose initially assigned value never changes is referred to as a <em>constant</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="differentiating-programming-languages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.4</span> Differentiating Programming Languages</h3>
<p>Programming languages are differentiated along the following dimensions: general-purpose vs. special-purpose, compiled or interpreted, typed or typeless, types of control structures available, and abstraction mechanisms. A general-purpose language is designed for a broad range of applications whereas, a special-purpose language is designed for a narrow use. For example, C++ is a general-purpose language whereas, SQL is specifically designed as query language for relational databases.</p>
<p>There are two ways to execute programs written in a high-level language: compilation and interpretation (discussed in Section <a href="Pano.html#SysSoft">1.3</a>. Some programming languages require all variables and their data types in a program be declared explicitly. Such languages are termed <em>strongly typed</em>. Type information is used to assess data type compatibility in program statements and in converting a value of one type to another. On the other hand, certain languages don’t require type declarations for variables and are referred to as <em>typeless</em> languages. In such languages, a variable can assume different data types during its lifetime. Those that fall in between are <em>weakly typed</em> languages.</p>
<p>Though there are only three fundamental control structures, some languages allow multiple forms of a control structure in the interest of naturally expressing the computational steps in the algorithmic solution. For example, some languages allow various forms of repetition control structure — <em>while loop</em>, <em>do while</em>, and <em>for loop</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="which-language-is-best" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.5</span> Which Language is Best?</h3>
<p>The question of which language is best cannot be answered without considering the problem context. The choice of a language depends on the type of computer the program is to run on, the nature of the problem to be solved, and the expertise of the programmer. Every language has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, FORTRAN 77 is a particularly good language for processing numerical data, but it does not lend itself well to organizing large programs. Pascal is very good for writing well-structured and readable programs, but it is not as flexible as the C programming language, especially for systems programming. C++ embodies powerful object-oriented features, but it is fraught with cryptic syntax and is difficult to learn. C# combines desirable object-oriented features of C++ and the event-driven programming ease of Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Abstraction mechanisms are needed to contain the complexity of large programs, and to improve program maintainability. <em>Procedure or function</em> is one such procedural abstraction where a set of statements are grouped under a name. A procedure or function solves a well-defined, small task in the domain and is invoked by other statements in the program. The procedure is often parameterized meaning that its computational behavior can be altered in pre-defined ways depending upon the values assigned to the parameters during its invocation. Other abstraction mechanisms include classes, modules, and components.</p>

<div id="ProgParadigms" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Programming paradigms</h2>
<p>At the highest level, there are two programming paradigms: imperative and declarative.</p>
<div id="imperative-paradigm" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Imperative Paradigm</h3>
<p><em>Imperative style of programming</em> is procedural in nature. A program consists of a number of statements that specify <em>how</em> a particular task gets accomplished. Another way to look at imperative programming is that it describes a system as evolving from an initial state through a series of state changes to a set of desired final states. For example, the statement ``DaysWorked = DaysWorked + 5,&quot; will take the system from its current state (in which the variable DaysWorked has some value) to a new state in which the variable DaysWorked has a value five more than the value of DaysWorked in the previous state of the system. Imperative languages are also known as procedural languages. C++, C#, and Java are procedural languages.</p>
<div id="classical-procedural-languages" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1.1</span> Classical Procedural Languages</h4>
<p>Procedural languages require imperative style of programming. FORTRAN, COBOL, and C are other examples of classical procedural languages. FORTRAN is an acronym for FORmula TRANslation and is used in science and engineering applications. It is the oldest high-level programming language. COBOL is an acronym for COmmon Business Oriented Language. It was developed in the early 1960s. It is the second-oldest high-level programming language. It is particularly popular for business applications that run on mainframe computers. COBOL programs are verbose. Therefore, they tend to be much longer than the same programs written in other languages. However, the wordiness makes it easy to understand COBOL programs. COBOL is still one of the most widely used programming language. In contrast with COBOL, C is a very compact in its syntax. It is widely used for systems and applications programming.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="object-oriented-languages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Object-oriented Languages</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming languages are also procedural languages. Object-oriented programming is based on the notion of an object and related concepts. An object is an abstraction that represents a real-world thing. An object is characterized by its structure, behavior, and identity. Structure of an object is specified by variables, and its behavior (or functional capability) is manifested by the methods associated with the object. Each object is required to be uniquely identified by some identification mechanism. All objects with identical characteristics are grouped into a class. The objects are referred to as the <em>instances</em> of the class.</p>
<p>Consider a <em>Student</em> object in the university environment. The object state is characterized by student ID, social security number (SSN), student name, major, classification, date of birth, hours completed, and GPA. Possible object methods are: computing age and GPA. Though we can assign attributes such as StudentID or Social Security Number (SSN) as object identifiers, usually identifiers are system generated ones that are guaranteed to be unique. Once an identifier has been assigned to an object, it never changes. This is one of the reasons why we don’t want to assign StudentID or SSN as object identifiers. The collection of all <em>Student</em> objects constitutes the <em>Student</em> class.</p>
<p>A single class by itself has limited functionality. Complex systems are built by employing several classes. An object of a class requests services of another object belonging to a different class by sending a message to the latter (referred to as message passing). New classes are created from existing classes using a mechanism known as <em>inheritance</em>. The new class inherits all the structure and functionality of the class from which it is inherited. In addition, the new class can selectively override the inherited functionality as well as extend the functionality by adding new variables and methods.</p>
<p>One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over classical procedural languages is that the object-oriented programs are easier to modify and maintain. There are several object-oriented programming languages including Smalltalk, C++, Java, and C#.</p>
<div id="scripting-languages" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2.1</span> Scripting Languages</h4>
<p>In the simplest sense, a script is a sequence of statements executed by an interpreter. Languages which are used to write scripts are called scripting languages. Scripts are used as a glue to effect interoperability between various applications, and functions featured by the scripting language itself. Examples include UNIX Shell scripts and MS DOS batch files. Scripting languages are weakly typed or typeless and has little or no provision for complex data structures.</p>
<p>Other scripting languages include VBScript, JavaScript, Jscript, and Perl. Script languages assumed more prominence and widespread use in the context of Web programming. VBScript (Visual Basic Script) was developed by Microsoft. Internet Explorer Web browser can execute VBScript programs. VBScript is based on the Visual Basic programming language. It enables Web authors to include interactive controls, such as buttons and scroll bars, on Web pages.</p>
<p>JavaScript was developed by Netscape to enable Web authors to develop interactive sites. It is supported by the recent browsers from Netscape and Microsoft. However, Microsoft Internet Explorer supports only a subset of JavaScript, which Microsoft refers to as JScript. Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) is an scripting language designed for processing text. Because of its strong text processing abilities, Perl has become one of the most popular languages for writing CGI scripts (required in developing dynamic Web sites).</p>
</div>
<div id="markup-language" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2.2</span> Markup Language</h4>
<p>These languages are used to markup documents of various sorts for different purposes. Markup may be done to indicate how a document should be rendered for display purpose as in the case of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Markup may also be done to indicate both logical structure and layout information (i.e., typesetting) as in the case of . Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a generic language for representing a document’s content, its logical structure, and the relationships between the content and the logical structure. SGML allows document-based information to be shared and re-used across applications and computer platforms in an open, vendor-neutral format. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a new markup language introduced recently that has gained prime importance in e-commerce applications. XML is based on SGML.</p>
</div>
<div id="page-description-language" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2.3</span> Page Description Language</h4>
<p>Page Description Languages (PDL) are used to describe the layout of documents for display and printing in a manner that is independent of the original application software, hardware, and operating system that was used to create those documents. Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard PCL (Printer Control Language) are PDLs used to control laser printers. Both PostScript and modern versions of PCL are object-oriented. They describe a page in terms of geometrical objects such as lines, arcs, and circles.</p>
<p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is a native file format for Adobe Systems’ Acrobat. A PDF file can describe documents containing text, graphics, and images in a device- and resolution-independent format. PDF supports color and is very compact in terms of storage requirements. PDF documents can be extremely large running into tens of thousands of pages.</p>
<p>Displaying and printing using PDL is a two-stage process: an application program first produces document layout description in PDF language, which is then interpreted by a specific output device. PDLs, therefore, serve as an interchange standard for transmission and storage of printable documents.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="declarative-paradigm" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3</span> Declarative Paradigm</h3>
<p><em>Declarative style of programming</em> focuses on specifying <em>what</em> needs to be accomplished, rather than <em>how</em> it will be accomplished. It can be thought of as specifying relationships between different variables in terms of functions or inference rules. Interpreter or compiler applies some fixed algorithm to these relations to produce a result. Consider the statement ``DaysInWeek = DaysInWorkWeek + 2.&quot; It declares DaysInWeek to have a value of two more than the value of DaysInWorkWeek. Variables, once declared or initialized, cannot change their value. There is no concept of states and state transitions. The most common examples of declarative languages are logic programming languages such as Prolog and functional languages like Haskell.</p>
<div id="functional-languages" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3.1</span> Functional Languages</h4>
<p>athematically speaking, a function is a rule that transforms input into unique output. In other words, it is a relationship between a set of inputs and an output. From programming perspective, a function is regarded as an operation, which when passed specific values as input produces output.</p>
<p>Functional programming is a type of declarative programming in which functions are treated as first-class objects meaning that (among other things) functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. A function can also return another function as its result. A program in a functional language consists of a set of (possibly recursive) function definitions and an expression whose value is output as the program’s result. They are based on typed lambda-calculus with constants. There are no side-effects to expression evaluation so an expression will always evaluate to the same value. An expression can always be replaced by its value without changing the overall result. Programs written in a functional language are generally compact and elegant. Until recently, they tended to run slowly and required a lot of memory. Examples of functional languages are Clean, FP, Haskell, Hope, LML, Miranda and SML.</p>
<p>Other languages such as Lisp have a subset which is purely functional but also contain non-functional constructs. LISP is a high-level programming language especially popular for developing artificial intelligence applications. Some mathematical computing systems such as Maple feature functional programming.</p>
</div>
<div id="logic-programming-language" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.7.3.2</span> Logic Programming Language</h4>
<p>Logic programming is also a form of declarative programming. Logic programs are specified by listing facts and rules in the problem domain. Computation takes the form of answering user queries, which usually require yes/no type answers or assigning constants to variables so that the rules in which the variables are used evaluate to true. Application independent rules of inference are used in answering user queries. Inference can proceed in top down (goal-driven) or bottom up (data-driven) fashion. PROLOG (PROgramming LOGic) is a high-level programming language based on formal logic. It is used widely in artificial intelligence applications, particularly in expert systems.</p>

<div id="AbstractMacHierarchy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Abstract Machine Hierarchy</h2>
<p>he innate abstraction level of interface to a computer is at too low-level, which makes it hard to use. To raise the level of abstraction and to increase human productivity with computers, the notion of abstract machine hierarchy is introduced. An <em>abstract machine hierarchy</em> consists of a number of layers and each layer corresponds to a virtual machine except the bottom layer which corresponds to a real, physical machine. All machines have a programming language associated with them. As we go up from bottom layers to upper layers the corresponding virtual machines become more and more abstract. That is, a virtual machine’s computational steps closely reflect the computational steps that are natural to the application domain. Thus, application development becomes easier as there is less semantic gap between how a user views the computation in the domain and the way they are expressed in the virtual machine’s programming language. Translators are needed to translate programs in the language of virtual machine at layer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> into the language of the machine at layer <span class="math inline">\(n-1.\)</span></p>
<p>There are a few advantages to the abstract machine hierarchy. First, it provides users high-level abstractions to make the programming task easier and the resulting complexity is absorbed by the layers in between the top and bottom layers. Second, it also helps to develop software that is independent of platform and operating system specific considerations by using the higher level abstractions in the machine hierarchy. Cases in point are Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and Java Bytecodes. When a program is written in C#, first it is converted into an intermediate language, MSIL. Just before the program is run, an optimized machine language program is produced from the MSIL version by taking into consideration the characteristics of the target environment — the environment of the machine and the operating system under which the program will run. Same is true for programs developed using the Java language, the intermediate language representation being the Java bytecode. A disadvantage with the abstract machine hierarchy is that the programs will run slower as they need to go through translations between the layers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>Computer Science is a broad discipline with a strong and coherent conceptual core. Subareas of computing discipline include Discrete Structures, Programming Fundamentals, Algorithms and Complexity, Architecture and Organization, Operating Systems, Net-Centric Computing, Programming Languages, Human-Computer Interaction, Graphics and Visual Computing, Intelligent Systems, Information Engineering, Software Engineering, Computational Science and Numerical Methods, and Social and Professional Issues. From an end user perspective, there are three aspects: physical computers, system software, and application software.</p>
<p>There are various classes of computers ranging from hand-helds to supercomputers with varying price and performance characteristics, each targeted for a specific market segment.</p>
<p>System software includes the operating system, compilers, interpreters, assemblers, loaders, linkers, and debuggers. End users, though interact with the operating system through a command-line or graphical user interface, by and large the system software is of interest to application software developers.</p>
<p>Practical applications of computers are far and wide. They range from a simple word processors to sophisticated enterprise resource planning systems.</p>
<p>Embedded software is a special type of software used in embedded systems. It is permanently built into Read Only Memory (ROM) and controls the system into which it is embedded.</p>
<p>Web related software include Web server, Web browser, and application-specific browser plug-ins. Web servers and browser use HTTP is a standard protocol for their communication. ASP.NET and JSP are two widely used technologies for developing Web based applications.</p>
<p>There is a large assortment of programming languages. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Which language is appropriate for a given problem is dependent on the nature of the problem, the computer on which the program will run, and the expertise of the programmer.</p>
<p>Any programming language that supports three fundamental control structures — sequence, conditional, and iteration — is computationally complete. That is, the language has sufficient expressive power to encode solution to any algorithmic problem.</p>
<p>There are two styles of programming: imperative and declarative. Imperative style of programming requires detailed specification of steps involved in solving a problem. All procedural languages are imperative. They include classical languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL, C as well as object-oriented programming languages such as C++, Java, and C#.</p>
<p>There are also scripting languages which act as a glue in providing loose interoperability between various application components. Scripting is quite popular in UNIX environments in which various script interpreters are provided (e.g., Bourne Shell, C Shell, Korn Shell). Script languages such as VBScript and JavaScript are used in developing interactive Web applications.</p>
<p>Markup languages are used to markup documents for various purposes including specifying the logical structure of a document (as in SGML), specifying both logical structure and rendering information (as in ), and rendering information only (as in HTML). XML is a recent markup language which is used to specify both the document structure and data semantics.</p>
<p>Page description languages are used to describe page layout and rendering information in an application- and platform-independent manner. Examples of this category include Hewlett-Packard’s PCL and Adobe System’s postscript language and PDF.</p>
<p>Declarative style of programming requires specifying only the problem that needs to be solved. Examples of this category include functional programming languages such as Miranda and SML; logic programming languages such as PROLOG.</p>
<p>Abstract machine hierarchy helps to provide a high-level of abstraction in interfaces for interacting with computers. It also helps to develop software in a way independent of platform and operating system issues.</p>
